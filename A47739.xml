         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AT the end of the <hi>Firſt Part</hi> there is mention made of a <hi>Preface.</hi> In which I have laid open the ways and means by which <hi>George Fox</hi> and the firſt <hi>Quakers</hi> came by all that <hi>Complication</hi> of the <hi>Ancient Hereſies,</hi> with further <hi>Improvements,</hi> upon which they have ſet up. For it was none of their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</hi> They had neither <hi>Parts</hi> nor <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> ſufficient for ſuch an <hi>Enterpriſe.</hi> But the <hi>Second Part</hi> Swelling ſo much, with the <hi>Collection,</hi> beyond the first Intended Bounds: And the <hi>Quakers</hi> laſt <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>The Snake,</hi> which they call <hi>Anguis</hi> or <hi>Switch,</hi> having come out ſince: And it being thought neceſſary, That ſomething ſhou'd be ſaid to it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly (becauſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> make ſuch <hi>Boaſts</hi> of it) tho' in Effect it is <hi>Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> already in this <hi>Reply;</hi> I have, to Eeaſe the Bulk of this, Reſerv'd the <hi>Preface</hi> to my Reflections upon the <hi>Switch,</hi> which will be the ſhorter, becauſe there will need little more than Applying their <hi>Anſwers</hi> in the <hi>Switch,</hi> to thoſe <hi>Methods</hi> (ſet down in the <hi>Second Part</hi>) which they uſe in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
<pb facs="tcp:95758:8"/>of Books that are wrote againſt them. And ſo that will ſerve as a <hi>Third Part</hi> to this; And be the Laſt I intend upon this Subject. Becauſe I think to make it very Plain, that by their <hi>Anſwers</hi> in the <hi>Switch,</hi> they muſt be Satisfied and Know in their Hearts, that theſe <hi>Hereſies, &amp;c.</hi> are Juſtly Charg'd upon them; And that they have Taught them.</p>
            <p>Onely here let me take Notice of an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> lately come out to the <hi>Preface</hi> of the <hi>Snake,</hi> concerning <hi>Miſ. Bourignon,</hi> in an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology</hi> wrote in <hi>Defence</hi> of her, and her <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein the <hi>Author</hi> ſhews, That he is not without <hi>Paſſion</hi> at what he calls <hi>Paſſion</hi> in others. But he vents it not in that <hi>Furious, Naſty</hi> Faſhion as the <hi>Quakers.</hi> He calls that <hi>Zeal</hi> which is Expreſt in the <hi>Preface</hi> againſt <hi>Bourignoniſm, Spiteful</hi> and <hi>Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> But that <hi>Author</hi> cou'd have no <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> againſt her <hi>Perſon,</hi> whom he knew no otherwiſe than by her <hi>Writings.</hi> And if the <hi>Doctrins</hi> ſhe Taught were ſuch as he has there Repreſented them, believe it, there was Cauſe for all that <hi>Concern,</hi> and more than is there Expreſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95758:9"/>Now whether they are truly Repreſented in that <hi>Preface,</hi> will appear plain enough by the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it. Which Denies not the <hi>Quotations,</hi> but by <hi>Contrary Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> and ſome other of the <hi>Quaker-Methods</hi> here ſet down, wou'd <hi>Squeeze</hi> and <hi>Force</hi> the Words out of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Signification, which yet can not be done.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Apologiſt</hi> accuſes the <hi>Author</hi> of that <hi>Preface</hi> of <hi>Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Un-chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs.</hi> Why? Becauſe he do's not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon and Recommend the <hi>Good</hi> things in <hi>Mſ. Bourignons</hi> Writings, as well as Expoſe what he thought <hi>Dangerous</hi> and <hi>Deſtructive.</hi> But this was Blaming with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Cauſe. For it was <hi>Dangerous</hi> things only which ought to be Expos'd. And they were the more <hi>Dangerous,</hi> becauſe they were Mixt with <hi>Good</hi> things, as <hi>Satan</hi> when Transformed into an <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Light.</hi> To Praiſe whoſe <hi>Light</hi> wou'd not be the way to <hi>Diſcover</hi> him. No. We muſt look for the <hi>Cloven-Foot.;</hi> And <hi>Pull off</hi> the <hi>Sheeps-Cloathing</hi> to find out the <hi>Wolf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Apologiſt</hi> ſets down his <hi>Belief,</hi> in most <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Moving</hi> terms. And
<pb facs="tcp:95758:9"/>I do <hi>Believe</hi> him. And think him a Man of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Sincere</hi> Intentions. And that he has been deluded by the ſeeming <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Self-Denyal,</hi> and <hi>Abſtractedneſs</hi> from the <hi>World</hi> that Appears thro' the <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of <hi>Mſ. Bourignon.</hi> Therefore I do with Great <hi>Charity,</hi> and an Hearty <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,</hi> Beſeech him and <hi>others</hi> who follow her <hi>Devotion,</hi> to conſider, whether it cou'd come from <hi>God,</hi> and Cover ſuch Terrible <hi>Doctrins,</hi> as overturn the very <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of our <hi>Chriſtian Faith?</hi> Such as <hi>CHRIST's Dying</hi> being only by <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident:</hi>—That He came not with a Deſign to <hi>Suffer:</hi>—That it was not Conſiſtent with the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God.;</hi> Nor needful as a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for our <hi>Sins:</hi>—And other things mention'd in that <hi>Preface.</hi> I would Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke their <hi>Zeal</hi> to be more for the ſupport of the True <hi>Chriſtian Doctrin,</hi> than for the <hi>Flights</hi> of <hi>Mſ. Bourignon</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which we do not Want. We have the <hi>Lives</hi> of the <hi>Holy Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apoſtles,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelf for our <hi>Examples.</hi> There is no <hi>Addition</hi> to them in the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Mſ. Bourig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi>

               <p>To ſhew which Effectually, I will give a ſhort <hi>Scheme</hi> of the <hi>Quakers Principles:</hi> And lay open the Monſtrous <hi>Foundation</hi> of them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not only the Foul <hi>Fallacy</hi> of their <hi>Anſwer</hi> is Detected; but their <hi>Blaſphemous Hereſies</hi> made more Apparent.</p>
               <p>Firſt then I will Grant that that <hi>Paragraph</hi> in their <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Queres, We ſincerely Believe in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. is ſet down in moſt <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox words,</hi> moſtly in the <hi>Terms</hi> of the <hi>Creed.</hi> Why then ſhou'd we Quarrel with them? Why will we not let men tell their own Meaning? Why will we not Believe what they Profeſs? Wou'd this ſeem Equal Dealing with other Men? What more ought to be Expected from them, than to bring them to ſubſcribe the very words of our <hi>Creed?</hi> What Better, or other words can we find as a <hi>Teſt</hi> for them?</p>
               <p>But it was told in the <hi>Concluſion</hi> of the <hi>Sn.</hi> That <hi>they cou'd Subſcribe the whole</hi> Creed, <hi>and yet not mean one word of it, of a</hi> Perſonal Chriſt <hi>Exiſting now in</hi> Heaven, <hi>in His own true</hi> Human <hi>Nature, without all other men</hi> &amp;c. Therefore they were Deſir'd to give a plain <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay</hi> but to <hi>Two</hi> ſhort <hi>Queres,</hi> upon that Head. Which they will not do.</p>
               <p>Now leſt this ſhou'd ſeem an Unreaſonable Impoſition upon them: and to ſhew the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ther was good Grounds, and even <hi>Neceſſity</hi> for all this <hi>Caution</hi> with them, I will ſet down in as Clear a Light as I can, the <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom</hi> and <hi>Foundation</hi> of this their <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi> which indeed is <hi>wonderful:</hi> And without

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt know then, That they do hold (with the <hi>Anthropomorphits</hi> and <hi>Muggletonians</hi>) that <hi>God</hi> has a <hi>Body,</hi> of <hi>Fleſh, Blood,</hi> and <hi>Bones:</hi> And that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> had ſuch a <hi>Body</hi> from <hi>Eternity.</hi> And that this was an <hi>Human</hi> Body.

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Humanity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> they call <hi>Spiritual, Heavenly, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncreated.</hi> And they Diſtinguiſh it from that <hi>Manhood</hi> which He took of <hi>our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> in the Womb of the B. <hi>Virgin:</hi> which they call <hi>Earthly, Corruptible, Created,</hi> and <hi>Outward</hi> Manhood.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Tho', while they Appear'd in them, they might be call'd <hi>Their</hi> Bodies, as being us'd or <hi>Poſſeſs'd</hi> by them. So, and no otherwiſe, the <hi>Quakers</hi> call the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> His <hi>Body.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p>For the <hi>First</hi> then. That <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> was a <hi>Man</hi> from <hi>Eternity</hi> &amp;c. ſee <hi>Tho. Ellwood</hi>'s Anſwer <hi>to</hi> G. Keith's <hi>Narrative.</hi> p. 96. 97. where he Delivers <hi>Will, Penn's</hi> true ſenſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95758:16"/>and Meaning. <hi>The Plain Import of all his</hi> (W. P<hi>'s</hi>) <hi>Arguments</hi> (ſays <hi>T. E.</hi>) <hi>is, That Christ, as Christ, was from the Beginning, before He took that</hi> outward Body <hi>of</hi> Fleſh, <hi>in which He ſuffer'd at</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>which is ſo far from a Denyal of His being,</hi> Man, <hi>as well as</hi> God, <hi>that it is a fair Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlegement of it; inaſmuch as He wou'd not have been</hi> Chriſt, <hi>if He had not been</hi> Man, <hi>as well as</hi> God. <hi>As therefore He was</hi> Chriſt <hi>from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſo was He alſo both</hi> God <hi>and</hi> Man; <hi>and that not only</hi> In <hi>his People, but</hi> out of, <hi>or</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them <hi>alſo. And if He was</hi> Truly <hi>Man</hi> Then, <hi>before He Appear'd in that</hi> outward Body, <hi>which was Nailed to the Croſs, to be ſure, He is not leſs</hi> Truly <hi>Man now; ſince that</hi> outward Manhood <hi>became (as I may ſay) a</hi> Cloathing <hi>to that</hi> Divine <hi>and</hi> Heavenly Manhood <hi>which He had before.</hi> Thus <hi>T. E. wrote</hi> lately, <hi>An.</hi> 1696. And ſhews what their <hi>Principles</hi> are <hi>Now. viz.</hi> That ther are <hi>Two Manhoods</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> the one <hi>outward;</hi> which ſerv'd only as a <hi>Cloathing</hi> to the <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Manhood.</hi> That <hi>Christ</hi> had not been <hi>Christ,</hi> if He had not been <hi>Man,</hi> as well as <hi>God;</hi> And therefore, That He was <hi>Man</hi> from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, as well as <hi>God.</hi> And Conſequently, That <hi>God,</hi> was <hi>Man,</hi> from <hi>Eternity:</hi> For <hi>Christ</hi> or the <hi>Eternal word,</hi> was no other than <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let Us go a little Back, and ſee the ſame Doctrine taught by the <hi>Quakers</hi> formerly. <hi>Iſaac Penington</hi> in his <hi>Queſtion to the Profeſſors,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>He that knoweth the Subſtance, the Seed of the Kingdom, the Birth of the Spirit, knoweth the Fleſh and Blood which is of the Seed. And this Fleſh is Fleſh indeed, this Blood is Blood indeed, even the Fleſh and Blood of the Seeds Nature; But the other was but the Fleſh and Blood of our Nature, which He honoured in taking upon Him, in which He did the will, in which He offer'd up the Acceptable Sacrifice; but yet did not give the Honour from His own Fleſh and Blood to It. For the Fleſh and Blood of our Nature, was not His own Naturally, but only as He pleas'd to take it upon Him, and make it His. But that whereof He formeth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and which He giveth us to Eat and Drink, is the Fleſh and Blood of His own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And this was It wherein was the Virtue, and wherein is the Virtue, Life, and Power for Ever. Happy, O happy is he who is of It, who is taken out of and Formed of Him</hi> (<hi>as</hi> Eve <hi>was of</hi> Adam) <hi>and ſo becomes Fleſh of His Fleſh, and Bone of His Bone.</hi> &amp;c. This was the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Bone</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly</hi> and <hi>Eternal Manhood,</hi> which he calls of the <hi>Seed</hi>'s Nature, that is of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not as He was of the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> after the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but as He is the <hi>Seed</hi> or <hi>Light</hi> in our <hi>Hearts;</hi> for <hi>I. P.</hi> calls this the <hi>Seed</hi>'s own <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> of <hi>His own Nature.</hi> And Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes it from the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> which he took of <hi>our Nature.</hi> And ſays, that the <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> is not in that, but in the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>His own Nature. Not the Fleſh and Blood</hi> (ſays he <hi>p.</hi> 25.) <hi>of the outward Earthly Nature; but the Flesh and Blood of the Inward ſpiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Not the Fleſh and Blood which Chriſt took of the firſt Adam's Nature; but the Fleſh
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95758:17"/>and Blood of the Second</hi> Adam<hi>'s Nature.</hi> This is of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>God.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 10 ſays, <hi>We are taught both by the Spirit, and by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to Diſtinguiſh between Chriſts</hi> own <hi>Flesh; and that of</hi> ours, <hi>which He took up, and made His.</hi> Ther is much more to the ſame Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in that Book of <hi>Penington</hi>'s, with which I will not Detain the Reader.</p>
               <p>The laſt Authority I ſhall Produce is of the Great <hi>Fox</hi> Himſelf, in his Book call'd, <hi>Several Papers given forth for the Spreading of Truth</hi> &amp;c. Printed, 1671. There p. 54. is a <hi>Chapter</hi> which bears this Title, <hi>Concerning Chriſt's Fleſh which was Offered</hi> &amp;c. And this <hi>Fleſh</hi> he makes not to be <hi>That</hi> which He took of the B. <hi>Virgin,</hi> but <hi>That,</hi> which he had from the Beginning, and which he ſuppoſes was <hi>Crucify'd</hi> when <hi>Adam</hi> Fell: And in That <hi>Crucifixion</hi> to Conſiſt the <hi>Atonement</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> made for <hi>Sin.</hi> And he takes that Text, <hi>The Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the world,</hi> not as then <hi>Decreed</hi> and <hi>Purpoſed</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>Literally,</hi> as then Actually <hi>Fulfill'd.</hi> Thus he Begins that Chapter. <hi>Chriſt, the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the world; when it began its Foundation, then the Lamb was ſlain— And Chriſt, according to the Fleſh, Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the Lamb ſlain, that Fleſh of His, which is a Myſterie, when the firſt</hi> Adam's <hi>and</hi> Eve's <hi>Fleſh was Defiled.</hi> This he calls a <hi>Myſtery.</hi> And it is the true <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Quakeriſm.</hi> It is upon this account, That the <hi>Quakers</hi> think all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world to Lie in Darkneſs but Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. That other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> know of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but that <hi>outward Fleſh,</hi> which He took, in Time, of the B. <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:95758:18"/>Hence it is common in their <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> and in their <hi>Books,</hi> to tell others, That the <hi>Fleſh</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a <hi>Myſterie;</hi> That they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand nothing of it.

But it Argues their Deep <hi>Deceit</hi> and <hi>Hypocricy,</hi> to ſeem to Juſtifie themſelves to the world, by their General Confeſſions; But Conceal their <hi>ſecret</hi> Meaning, whereby they know that they <hi>Differ</hi> moſt <hi>Wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> from thoſe, with whom they make this Falſe <hi>Appearance</hi> of <hi>Agreeing</hi> Exactly.</p>
               <p>Therefore their <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Queres</hi> is no <hi>Anſwer,</hi> while they Refuſe to Renounce this Diſtinction that they have of Different <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods</hi> in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> or otherwiſe, to Explain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and tell us, which of the <hi>Manhoods</hi> they mean.

Whether that <hi>Eternal</hi> or <hi>Heavenly Manhood</hi> before ſpoke of, or the <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Terreſtrial Manhood,</hi> which he took of our <hi>Earth?</hi> But <hi>Tho.

               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>Quakers</hi> have never yet been able to give us any <hi>Mark</hi> or <hi>Rule</hi> or ſhew of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> that they do not thus miſtake All their

               <p>We ſee (and <hi>G. W.</hi> cannot but own it) to what Exceſſive Heights this <hi>Enthuſiaſtical</hi> Principle has driven ſome of the <hi>Quakers:</hi> therefore let the Reſt beware, for they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Rode.</p>
               <p>They have loſt their <hi>Compaſs,</hi> while they ſet their <hi>Light</hi> above the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> And have no other <hi>Aſſurance</hi> that they are in the <hi>Right,</hi> but their own <hi>Aſſurance</hi> that they are ſo. Which ſort of <hi>Aſſurance</hi> not only <hi>Sometimes,</hi> but <hi>Always</hi> do's accompany every <hi>Error:</hi> For no Man can be in any <hi>Error,</hi> who do's not think himſelf to be in the <hi>Right:</hi> Elſe he were not in an <hi>Error;</hi> but in a <hi>Willful</hi> Obſtinacy if he Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in it, after he knew it it to be an <hi>Error.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to <hi>Christians</hi> who believe the <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> of the H. <hi>Scriptures,</hi> theſe are a <hi>Rule,</hi> by which we meaſure our own <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> and if any thing comes into our Heads contrary to theſe, we are bound to Reject it: But to believe it a <hi>Divine Inſpiration,</hi> and ſo not Controulable by <hi>Scripture,</hi> this is to be <hi>Mad,</hi> to be given up to all <hi>Deluſion,</hi> to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render our Hearts, as a <hi>Blank Table</hi> for the <hi>Devil</hi> to write what he pleaſes upon, and to paſs it as the <hi>Ingravings</hi> of the <hi>Finger</hi> of <hi>God!</hi> And if ther be no <hi>Light,</hi> that is, no <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> in us, but what is <hi>Divine,</hi> we muſt think every thing <hi>Divine</hi> that is written there. And then we are <hi>Seal'd</hi> up in <hi>Error;</hi> from which ther can be no Returning while we keep in that <hi>Principle;</hi> the <hi>Scriptures</hi> can be no <hi>Reproof</hi> or <hi>Cheek</hi> to us, while we think
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95758:24"/>that what we call our <hi>Light with in</hi> is <hi>Superior</hi> to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and by which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> themſelves were given forth. And <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which is <hi>Human,</hi> and, as theſe Men term it, <hi>Carnal,</hi> can never be admitted by them to <hi>Rectify</hi> what they think to be <hi>Divine.</hi> So that all <hi>Avenues</hi> are ſtopt to their <hi>Recovery.</hi> This is the moſt <hi>Dreadful</hi> condition that any Man can be ſuppos'd to be in. It is <hi>Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> to any thing but a <hi>Miracle.</hi> Therefore you ſee what Reaſon we have to Remove Men from this <hi>Principle.</hi> And this is the <hi>Heart</hi> of <hi>Quakeriſm.</hi> They Reckon themſelves <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi> without <hi>Reaſon.</hi> They are <hi>ſure,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>ſure.</hi> And this ſort of <hi>Aſſurance</hi> proceeds from the <hi>Imagination;</hi> and therefore is ſtrongeſt in <hi>Mad-Men:</hi> And the <hi>Maddeſt</hi> of the <hi>Quarkers,</hi> the moſt highly <hi>Enthuſiaſtick,</hi> have the ſtrongeſt <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of this kind. How different are theſe Men from thoſe ſort of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> writes, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes them, <hi>To be Ready always to give an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to every Man that asked them a</hi> Reaſon <hi>of the Hope that was in them?</hi> 1 Pet. 3.15. But our <hi>Quakers</hi> give no <hi>Reaſon;</hi> they cry out upon <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as <hi>Carnal;</hi> and are againſt <hi>It,</hi> becauſe <hi>It</hi> is againſt them. For no <hi>Reaſon</hi> can be given for any <hi>Hope</hi> or <hi>Inward Perſwaſion</hi> which is not Grounded upon <hi>Reaſon. Fancy</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> are two things. And no <hi>Reaſon</hi> can be given for <hi>Fancy.</hi> This is the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> or <hi>Aſſurance</hi> which comes from the <hi>Sobriety</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and that which comes from <hi>Enthuſiaſm. Enthuſiaſm</hi> is <hi>Imagination;</hi> and no <hi>Reaſon</hi> can be given for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95758:24"/>what <hi>Aſſurance</hi> comes from thence. But the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> is a <hi>Sober</hi> and a <hi>Rational Perſuaſion,</hi> Grounded upon <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ther is always a <hi>Reaſon</hi> to be given for it.</p>
               <p>This do's not take away or leſſon the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> of the <hi>Ordinarie Aſſiſtances</hi> and <hi>Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the H. <hi>Spirit;</hi> which are, in a ſound ſenſe, call'd likewiſe <hi>Enthuſiaſm.</hi> This is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, and the difference of <hi>Enthuſiaſms</hi> clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid down in the <hi>Sn.</hi> Sect. xxii. But I have ſaid ſo much of it, in this place, that <hi>Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept, here a Little and there a Little,</hi> I might, by any means, Inſtill this Difference of the <hi>Quaker</hi> from the <hi>Divine Enthuſiaſm</hi> into their Minds; and Guard them from this <hi>Fundamental</hi> Error, which carries in its Belly, all the others into which they are led: And of which they muſt firſt be Cur'd, before they can be Retriv'd from any other. And, to Repeat it again, that they may keep their Eye ſtill upon this <hi>One</hi> Point; all I deſire of them is, to let their <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> or <hi>Inſpiration</hi> be <hi>Subject</hi> to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and not ſet up <hi>Above</hi> them. This was the Rule in all Holy <hi>Enthuſiaſms;</hi> they ſubmitted to be <hi>Try'd</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd</hi> by the <hi>Rule</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Then we have ſome <hi>Rule,</hi> ſome <hi>Compaſs</hi> to <hi>Steer</hi> by. But if we ſet our <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> Above the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> this is the <hi>Wild,</hi> the <hi>Mad,</hi> the <hi>Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Enthuſiaſm</hi> of which I have been ſpeaking. And of which if the <hi>Quakers</hi> were once Cur'd, they wou'd, with the Bleſſing of God, ſoon Return to a <hi>Sober</hi> Mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:95758:25"/>4. <hi>G. W.</hi> is very Angry it ſhou'd be ſaid that the <hi>Quaker Principles</hi> do make men more <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of the wild Impreſſions of Enthuſiaſm</hi> than other Men. And ſays againſt this, that as few of them have run <hi>Mad</hi> as of other Men. And p. 8. he Provokes his Adverſary to produce his <hi>Catalogues</hi> of the <hi>Quaker — Mad-Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why truly, if <hi>Catalogues</hi> had been kept of them, I believe they wou'd be found to Exced any of ſuch a Number of Men, by the Inſtances which we have ſeen of them.</p>
               <p>All of which <hi>G. W.</hi> wou'd throw off; by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancing in a Few, whom, he ſays, they have Diſowned. Thus ſays he p. 3. 4. <hi>His Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of</hi> John Gilpin <hi>in</hi> 1653. James Milner, <hi>and</hi> John Toldervy, <hi>cannot affect the</hi> Quakers, <hi>ſince they have Long ſince teſtifi'd againſt the Madneſs of thoſe Perſons he Mentions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. 1. Other Perſons were Mention'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe; And ther are Many More of the Like.</p>
               <p>Anſ. 2. Theſe Perſons above Nam'd have not been <hi>Teſtify'd</hi> againſt as <hi>Mad-men</hi> by the <hi>Quakers.</hi> But, on the Contrary, <hi>James Milner</hi> is Juſtify'd for a <hi>True Prophet</hi> by <hi>G. Fox,</hi> after all the <hi>Madneſſes</hi> he was Guilty of. Which is ſhewn in the 2d. Part. Sect. ii. N. 7. <hi>G. F.</hi> calls him a <hi>True Prophet</hi> of <hi>The Lord.</hi> And <hi>G. W. Now</hi> calls him a <hi>Mad-Man:</hi> which I know not how to Reconcile, but by owning of the <hi>Truth,</hi> That the <hi>Quaker-Prophets</hi> are <hi>Mad-Men.</hi> If <hi>G. W.</hi> can find any other way, let him ſhew his <hi>Parts!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:95758:25"/>In the next Place, as to <hi>Toldervy,</hi> he went <hi>Back</hi> and <hi>Forward,</hi> And the <hi>Quakers</hi> did <hi>Own</hi> or <hi>Dis-own</hi> him, as he went <hi>To</hi> or <hi>From</hi> them. But I know not that they have made a <hi>Mad-Man</hi> of him, before this time, now, in this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote.</hi> If they thought him <hi>Mad</hi> they ſpent their time well, in writing ſo Many <hi>Books</hi> againſt him, And <hi>Anſwering</hi> of his Books!</p>
               <p>But as for <hi>Gilpin,</hi> he left them Quite, after he had (by the great mercy of God,) Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd from his ſo Monſtrous <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> by the <hi>Devil</hi> while he was a <hi>Quaker.</hi> He had enough of them! Therefore they Laid Load upon Him. But what was it they Charg'd him with? It is <hi>Horrible</hi> to Repeat it! They Miſtook the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> for <hi>God!</hi> They Attributed the <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> he was under to the H. <hi>Spirit;</hi> And ſaid, That they were the <hi>Workings</hi> of The <hi>Light within,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Heart;</hi> ſubduing the <hi>Devil,</hi> or his Corruptions; which <hi>Trembled</hi> in him: And that this was the Cauſe of his Dreadful <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions.</hi> That his Charging them upon the <hi>Devil,</hi> was <hi>Blaſpheming</hi> of <hi>God</hi> whoſe <hi>Work</hi> they were. That his ſeeking for <hi>Relief</hi> from them (which they call'd the <hi>Croſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) And not being willing to Ly Under them, was his Deſerting of <hi>God;</hi> And Returning under the Power of the <hi>Devil;</hi> being <hi>Weary</hi> of <hi>Bearing</hi> the <hi>Croſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>All this Appears by the <hi>Anſwers</hi> which the <hi>Quakers</hi> put out to this <hi>Relation</hi> which <hi>Gilpin</hi> gave of himſelf, call'd <hi>The Quakers Shaken.</hi> An 1653.

In all which Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Motions, I Acted not, in the Leaſt Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by a Natural Power of Mine own; Neither did I Reſiſt, or could I Reſiſt that Power which Acted Me; but was altogether Paſſive. I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, That it was the Immediate Power of Chriſt; And heard, to my thinking, a Voice ſpeaking to Me, and ſaying,</hi> That that writing with my hand upon the Ground, did ſignifie the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Law within my Heart. <hi>Having lain all night upon the Ground, in the Manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, The Power (as before in other Actions) moved my Hands to my Head, and laid them upon the Top thereof faſt Cloſed together; whereupon I heard a Voice ſaying,</hi> Chriſt in God, and God in Chriſt, and Chriſt in Thee; <hi>which words I was Compelled to Sing forth before the Company, in a ſtrange Manner, and with ſuch a Voice, as was not Naturally Mine own: I ſung alſo divers Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Scripture, which were given into Me. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which I was Raiſed from the Ground, and ſet upon my Feet, by the power within me; which bad me be Humble, and brought me down again upon
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95758:27"/>my Knees, and with a whiſpering Voice ſaid to me, Stoop Low, Low. And having ſtooped near the Ground with my Face, it ſaid to me,</hi> Take up thy Croſs and Follow Me. <hi>Whereupon Ariſing — I was ſuddenly Drawn down the ſtreet</hi> &amp;c. viz. To the <hi>Fidlers</hi> Houſe. whither <hi>William Dodding,</hi> and <hi>John Audland</hi> did Accompany him. And odd <hi>Freaks</hi> were Acted. I have Recited this Paſſage ſo Particularly, becauſe, as before Quoted, the <hi>Quakers</hi> do Maintain, That the <hi>Power</hi> which ſtruk <hi>Gilpin</hi> down from his <hi>Chair;</hi> and brought him Low down upon his <hi>Knees,</hi> bidding him be <hi>Humble</hi> &amp;c. was <hi>of God;</hi> But that which Led him to the <hi>Fidlers,</hi> and Mov'd him to Play upon the <hi>Baſe Viol,</hi> and <hi>Dance,</hi> was <hi>of the Devil.</hi> (as in the <hi>Standard</hi> &amp;c. p. 11.12.) whereas, it was the ſame <hi>Pow</hi>-that Acted him all along. And going to the <hi>Fidlers,</hi> was but a Part of the ſame Paſſage. But this ſhews how the <hi>Quakers</hi> hate <hi>Muſick.</hi> As that <hi>Power</hi> ſaid to <hi>Gilpin.</hi> p. 7. That it Hated <hi>Muſick,</hi> which ſhews it to be the ſame <hi>Power</hi> that Acts the <hi>Quakers;</hi> A <hi>Sullen, Doged Spirit, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-Tun'd,</hi> and <hi>In-Harmonious!</hi> The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes</hi> to <hi>Heaven!</hi> I ſuppoſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> thought, That it cou'd not be an <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> which bad <hi>Gilpin</hi> be <hi>Humble;</hi> that is, That the <hi>Devil</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.

But was it a <hi>Good Spirit</hi> which Tempted <hi>Gilpin</hi> to <hi>Deſpair,</hi> and to <hi>Cut</hi> his <hi>Throat?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 8.</note> as he tells that this <hi>Power</hi> did, which <hi>Poſſeſs'd</hi> him;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95758:28"/>And Promis'd that he ſhou'd have <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> if he wou'd do it. At which when he ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and began to ſuſpect that it muſt be an <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> which Tempted him to <hi>Self-Murder;</hi> Then the next <hi>Fit</hi> he had, the <hi>Spirit</hi> told him, That it was indeed an <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> which had Acted him all that time, under the Notion of the H. <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> But that Now the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> had come upon him, and Chas'd away that <hi>Evil Spirit;</hi> wherefore now that he might be ſure he was in the Right. And then again, upon other ſuch like Occaſion, the <hi>Voice</hi> wou'd tell him, That even that <hi>Spirit</hi> which pretended to be the <hi>Good Spirit,</hi> was ſtill the <hi>Evil Spirit;</hi> and had told him a Ly, on Purpoſe to <hi>Deceive</hi> him: But that now the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> was come in Good Earneſt, and that he might De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it. And thus for ſeveral times ſucceſſively, as oft as he Entertain'd <hi>Suſpitions</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> that Acted him; And he was as oft <hi>Deceiv'd</hi> by it. Cou'd this then be a <hi>Good Spirit,</hi> which ſo oft call'd it ſelf the <hi>Evil Spirit?</hi> For it is plain, by his Story, That it was the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> which all along Poſſeſs'd him, till he was finally Deviver'd from it, by Returning to the outward <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> which he had Forſaken. Was it a <hi>Good Spirit</hi> which Mov'd him, as he came from the <hi>Fidlers,</hi> to Proclaim through the ſtreets as he went, <hi>I am the way the Truth and the Life?</hi> And <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Dodding</hi> the <hi>Quaker</hi> in his Company: who did not Reprove this <hi>Blaſphemy:</hi> for it was Common with the <hi>Quakers</hi> (See §. vii.) But ſaid that he <hi>had</hi> no Power to Leave <hi>him.</hi> as he tells p. 7. This
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95758:28"/>was the <hi>Power</hi> Tormented <hi>Gilpin;</hi> which was ſurely no other than the <hi>Devil,</hi> who Tempted him thus to <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> and <hi>Self-Murder.</hi> But this <hi>G. Fox</hi> will not allow; but ſays (<hi>Gr. Myſt.</hi> p. 299.) That it was <hi>The Devil who was made to Tremble in Gilpin.</hi> Not that it was the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> who made <hi>Gilpin</hi> to <hi>Tremble.</hi> No, They ſay that was <hi>God.</hi> And that it was the <hi>Devil,</hi> not who <hi>Tormented,</hi> but who <hi>was Tormented</hi> in <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not Detain the Reader with the Reſt of <hi>Gilpin</hi>'s ſtory, which is indeed <hi>Prodigious:</hi> only make this Obſervation upon it, that, if it be True, ther can be no Doubt, of what many (Now a days) will not Believe, That ther are <hi>Diabolical Poſſeſſions.</hi> And that it is True, we have not only <hi>Gilpin</hi>'s own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but it is Atteſted by the then <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> (where <hi>Gilpin</hi> then Liv'd, And was ſo <hi>Poſſeſs'd</hi>) by the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and ſeveral other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Credit, there Preſent.</p>
               <p>But now ſuppoſe it was not True, Is it not as Great a Degree of <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> to make a Man Believe, That he had been ſo <hi>Poſſeſs'd,</hi> and Heard ſuch <hi>Voices</hi> &amp;c. if it had not been ſo? And the <hi>Tranſports</hi> he was in, were many of them ſuch as Exceeded the Power of <hi>Nature;</hi> which any one will Acknowledge that Reads his <hi>Narrative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can this be put upon the <hi>Common</hi> Effects of <hi>Madneſs;</hi> for no ſuch Effects were ever ſeen in <hi>Gilpin</hi> Before, or after he Return'd from the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or if it was <hi>Madneſs</hi> (of what ever ſort) it was Viſiby Caus'd by the <hi>Quaker Preachings,</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:95758:29"/>and their <hi>Doctrine.</hi> And <hi>Cur'd</hi> by Returning from them. And no doubt, but <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> when to a great Degree, will <hi>Tranſport</hi> Men, even unto <hi>Madneſs.</hi> Their is an <hi>Enthuſiaſtical,</hi> as well as a <hi>Natural</hi> Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>It is obſerv'd hereafter, that neither the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or any other Recorded in the H. <hi>Scriptures,</hi> were Converted to <hi>Christianity</hi> by ſuch <hi>Violent</hi> and <hi>Monſtrous</hi> ſort of <hi>Convulſions</hi> of their <hi>Bodies.</hi> Theſe are the <hi>Tranſports</hi> of <hi>Euries.</hi> But the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is all <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Sobriety,</hi> and <hi>Gravity.</hi>

               <p>But how will <hi>G. W.</hi> Reconcile his charging this of <hi>Gilpin</hi>'s upon <hi>Madneſs;</hi> and <hi>G. F's</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (<hi>Gr.

                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:95758:29"/>has Exerted His Power, in the ſame ſignal manner, upon many of thoſe who have will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>Excommunicated</hi> Themſelves, and Tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under their Feet that <hi>High Authority,</hi> with which <hi>Chriſt</hi> has Inveſted His <hi>Church!</hi> even the ſame that the <hi>Father</hi> gave unto <hi>Him.</hi> Of theſe <hi>Scorners,</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> are the moſt <hi>Outragious,</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemous:</hi> And therefore this <hi>Judgment</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> has fallen moſt upon <hi>Them.</hi> And this is the greateſt Part of their <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that they know it not to be ſuch: But miſtake the <hi>Strokes</hi> of God's <hi>Executioner,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> for the <hi>Workings</hi> of the H. <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> And ſo Conſtrue that as an <hi>Approbation</hi> of their <hi>Curſed</hi> ſtate, which was ſent to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim</hi> them from it.

               <p>To the ſame Purpoſe Anſwer'd <hi>G. Fox,</hi> in his <hi>Gr.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95758:30"/>means,</hi> God did wonderfully Deliver him from that <hi>Confuſion,</hi> which the <hi>Quakers</hi> call his <hi>Condemnation,</hi> his being Weary of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>However now <hi>G.

               </p>

               </p>

               <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> that in things of ſuch <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>Notorious</hi> Nature, it cannot be ſuppos'd that they wou'd <hi>Print</hi> a <hi>Lye,</hi> ſo ſoon, that is Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after (as by the date of their Book) ſuch things were done; when it wou'd have been in the Power of Every body in thoſe <hi>Towns</hi> to <hi>Contradict</hi> and <hi>Expoſe</hi> them.</p>

               <p>Now for this <hi>George Whitehead</hi> thus to aſſume the <hi>Stile</hi> of the moſt Extraordinary <hi>Prophets</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and to <hi>Fancie</hi> himſelf one of them, I think will be Judg'd a Greater <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> than if he had Fancy'd himſelf to be a <hi>Duke,</hi> or a <hi>Prince:</hi> for a <hi>Prophet</hi> Immediatly ſent from <hi>God,</hi> is certainly Cloath'd with a far Greater <hi>Honour</hi> than any that can be Beſtow'd by the moſt <hi>Splendid</hi> of <hi>Worldly Titles.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is no ordinary miſtake, or ſuch as cou'd befall any Man in his <hi>Wits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay farther (to ſhew the <hi>Exceſs</hi> of <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>'s Madneſs) Suppoſe he ſhou'd think that this <hi>Prophetical Curſe</hi> of his againſt <hi>G. Keith,</hi> to be not only <hi>Equal</hi> to any <hi>Propheſie</hi> Recorded in <hi>Scripture,</hi> but of <hi>Greater</hi> Authority than any <hi>Chapter</hi> in the <hi>Bible:</hi> wou'd any body, in this caſe, Excuſe him from the very <hi>Height</hi> of <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!</hi> And for this, ſee his <hi>Truth defending the Quakers</hi> An. 1659. p. 7. where this <hi>Queſtion</hi> was Demanded of him, <hi>Do you Eſteem your Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be of as Great Authority as any Chapters in the Bible?</hi> And he ſets down his own <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> in theſe words. <hi>That which is Spoken from the Spirit of Truth in any, is of as Great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as the Scriptures and Chapters are, and <hi>GREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER.</hi>
                  </hi> This he Repeats again in the ſame words, in his <hi>Serious Appology.</hi> An. 1671. p. 49. And Quotes his former Book, to ſhew that this was not ſpoke by Chance, but was a ſtanding Principle among them. Now then, if <hi>G. W.</hi> will ſay, That the <hi>Curſe</hi> which he ſent to <hi>G. Keith</hi> was <hi>Spoken by the Spirit of Truth,</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:95758:36"/>he owns, by his own words, that it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>As Great Authority as the Scriptures and Chapters are,</hi> but of GREATER! And then I think we need no further Proof of his being <hi>Stark-Mad.</hi> But, on the other hand, if he will, to ſave himſelf from this Imputation, Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that that <hi>Curſe</hi> was not <hi>Spoken by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth,</hi> then muſt he own himſelf Guilty of a moſt Notorious <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> to Dictate thus in the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and make <hi>God</hi> to ſpeak his <hi>Lies,</hi> and the <hi>Deluſions</hi> of his <hi>Beſotted Brain.</hi> And if this be not put upon the ſcore of <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> then ought <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> to ſuffer the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of a <hi>Blaſphemer.</hi> Therefore he ſhou'd Return his <hi>Thanks</hi> to thoſe who are ſo Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful as to Prove him only <hi>Non Compos</hi> (as of <hi>Felo de ſe</hi>) to ſave his <hi>Chattels</hi> and his <hi>Carcaſs</hi> too. But this is not only as to this <hi>Curſe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>G. K.</hi> (that is but one <hi>Inſtance</hi> among many) nor only as to <hi>G. W.</hi> but it Reaches to All that the <hi>Quakers</hi> have Deliver'd, <hi>In the Name of the Lord,</hi> not only againſt Particular Perſons, but the whole <hi>Church of England,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and the <hi>Lawyers</hi> too: they are Particularly mark'd out for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> if ever the <hi>Quakers</hi> do Prevail, they are the <hi>Midianites</hi> whom we muſt <hi>Vex,</hi> that is <hi>Deſtroy</hi> (ſee <hi>Sn.</hi> p. 230.) And if the many <hi>Thouſands</hi> of their followers in <hi>England</hi> do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (as they Profeſs) that what theſe their <hi>Leaders</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> have ſaid is all from the <hi>Mouth</hi> of The <hi>Lord,</hi> the Conſequence (beſides the <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> of it) muſt be very Dangerous: eſpecially ſince they have already Publiſht their <hi>Declaration</hi> wherein they Aſſert their <hi>Right</hi> and

                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:95758:37"/>inſtead of <hi>Anſwering. G. Fox</hi> in his <hi>Weſtmorland Petition.</hi> p. 5.

And <hi>G. W.</hi> anſwers not a word to any thing of this, but asks ſtill what Proof is ther in p. 44. when this very <hi>Proof</hi> is in p. 44. And I Deſire him now to Anſwer it.

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>George</hi> is a <hi>Cunning Whipſter,</hi> he had a farther Deſign in this than he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſhou'd be ſeen. He put in his <hi>Plea</hi> for their <hi>Quaking,</hi> as <hi>Proceeding from the word and Power of God,</hi> by ſaying <hi>How Proves he?</hi> i. e. the Contrary. But <hi>George</hi> Knew well enough that this <hi>Plea</hi> wou'd never Hold, therfore he wou'd not aſſert it <hi>Poſitively,</hi> only by an <hi>Innuendo.</hi> And then in the ſame p. 6. N. 7. he puts in another Excuſe (which he will as little ſtand by) as if this <hi>Quaking</hi> was only <hi>Fits</hi> of <hi>Convulſion,</hi> for thus ſays he, <hi>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95758:40"/>their Groſs Deceits, he Return'd from them; and then Gave notice of them to the World in a Book, printed 1655. which he Intituled <hi>The Worlds wonder, or The</hi> Quakers <hi>Blazing-Star</hi> &amp;c. there p. 22. he tells of theſe <hi>Myſterious Deceits</hi> of <hi>Anti-Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>Which I gather <hi>(ſays he)</hi> from thoſe ſtrange and unheard of Paſſions and Agonies, thoſe Great Burthens and Exercitations of Body, in ſo much that they are ſometimes in Trances and Soundings; and if they are not brought into ſuch a ſtate of Deadneſs as it were, yet they ſuffer moſt Extreme Tortures of Body, that hath been Viſible to me and ſeveral others many times, nay, ſo much Extremity that it maketh them Roar out for very Bitterneſs; And I do clearly Judge that if the Lord did not Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Devil in their behalf, as he did for <hi>Job,</hi> ſaying, Thou ſhalt not touch his Life, it wou'd be Impoſſible for their Concaves to hold their Inwards, in thoſe Violent Motions; for they are made under thoſe Agonies to Tremble and Quake, as though their Fleſh muſt part from their Bones and Ligatures, like unto Men in the ſtrongeſt Fits of an Ague that ever you ſaw, as tho' they had ſeen <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s Viſion. <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. that made his knees ſmite one againſt another. In thoſe ſtrange Paſſions they are Exerciſed with ſo much Heat (I know not of what ſort) that it maketh them cry out for Drink, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them Sweat like men in moſt violent Feavers. Now they call theſe Agonies the <hi>Fiery-Trial.</hi> and ſay it is the Power of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95758:40"/>Holy Ghoſt burning up and Deſtroying their Corruptions, and Purifying them like Gold that is tried ſeven times in the Fire. And that which is very ſtrange, when they are thus in the midſt of theſe Extreme Shakings, Quakings, Trials, Roarings and Perplexities, that one wou'd think ther cou'd be no more Torment upon the Damn'd Spirits than is upon them at the Preſent, yet many times, when they begin to come to their Speech (for it falleth out often that they are not able to ſpeak for a long time) they will ſpeak how much Joy and Pleaſure they have mix'd with that Torment, in ſuch an Inſeperable Manner, as they themſelves Expreſs, as Heat and Fire mix'd together, that they cou'd wiſh to be in it for Ever and Ever. This they call Drinking of the Cup, or the Undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Curſe and wrath of God as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, for here they ſpeak (to my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding moſt Blaſphemouſly) and ſay, they muſt be brought to ſuffer as Chriſt did, and to Undergo as Great a ſenſe of Wrath as He did, when he Cried out, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> In a word, as far as ever I cou'd Underſtand their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions by their Expreſſions in this laſt particular, I did Judge this to be their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, that they muſt ſuffer Eternal Burnings, bearing the full weight of Divine Juſtice and wrath, as fully as though ther never had been any <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucifi'd, or acceptation of His Sacrifice, untill, as they ſay, ther ſhou'd be no more left in them, but the Pure ſeed of God, in its own Perfect Likeneſs —</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:95758:41"/>And they ſay that Condition or ſtate which is call'd in Scripture <hi>Hell</hi> or <hi>Everlasting Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>—is but a Diſpenſation which ſhall End at ſuch a time, as that Burning and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Soul and Conſcience ſhall have Refin'd it, and brought it into its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Purity and Likeneſs of God.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Thus far I have tranſcrib'd out of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, not only as to this of their <hi>Quaking,</hi> but becauſe he do's withal open to us, the very Heart and Bottom of the <hi>Quaker Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</hi> viz. That the <hi>Meritorious Cauſe</hi> of our <hi>Juſtification</hi> is not the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in His <hi>Body</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs;</hi> but that the ſame ſufferings muſt be wrought over again in us, that we muſt Bear our own Sins, in our own Bodies, and muſt be Healed by our own Stripes; which likewiſe they call the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> or the <hi>Light</hi> within them. And that what he ſuffers thus within every man, is the only <hi>Meritorious</hi> Cauſe of. his <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> That what He ſuffer'd <hi>Outwardly</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs</hi> is nothing to us, but an <hi>Example,</hi> a <hi>History,</hi> or <hi>Facilt Repreſentation</hi> of the <hi>Greater Mystery</hi> of what He <hi>Suffers</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> within us: Wherein only the <hi>Atonement</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for <hi>Sin</hi> is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd. And this they ſuppos'd to be done in theſe Monſtrous <hi>Poſſeſſions</hi> of <hi>Quaking,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore were greatly Deſirous of them, as thinking their ſtate not ſecure till they had gone thro' one of theſe <hi>Fits</hi> at leaſt. As Mr. <hi>Skipp</hi> tells of himſelf, while he was a <hi>Quaker.</hi> p. 25. <hi>I thought it was my unhappineſs</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that I was not, and it was great Cauſe of trouble
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95758:41"/>and unſpeakable ſorrow to me, and that which caus'd me to complain bitterly time after time, but they wou'd tell me that I muſt wait for it, and they ſaid that they cou'd Believe for me, and they were Confident I ſhou'd be a very Glorious Piece,</hi> &amp;c. Here their <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Diſcerning</hi> fail'd them! But that which makes the long Quotation I have taken out of Mr. <hi>Skipp</hi> the more Valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is, becauſe <hi>G. Fox</hi> has wrote an Anſwer to it in his <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> where p. 314. he, after his uſual faſhion, <hi>Epitomizes</hi> and <hi>Falſifies</hi> Mr. <hi>Skipp's</hi> words above Quoted, thus, <hi>It is Blaſphemy to ſay we must fill up the ſufferings of Christ.</hi> Ther are no ſuch words in Mr. <hi>Skipp,</hi> not ſo put together; but he referrs to that Part above Quoted, where Mr. <hi>Skipp</hi> calls it <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> to ſay that they muſt ſuffer as <hi>Christ</hi> did, and are ſav'd by <hi>Their own</hi> ſufferings, and not by <hi>Christs.</hi> In which <hi>G. F.</hi> oppoſes Mr. <hi>Skipp,</hi> and ſays, in Anſwer, <hi>Thou hast not Drunk the Cup of the Wrath and Judgment of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and that you must Drink before you come to know the ſeed of God come from under all the Power of Wickedneſs in thee—And Christ who bore the Sin of the whole world, felt it, and was under it, and was offered, and over it all, and makes his Enemies his Foot-stool.</hi> This is all his Anſwer. And ſhews what he means, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what it is which he oppoſes; for without ſeeing the Books which he Pretends to Anſwer (of which few are now Extant) ther is no Underſtanding, by him, either what they ſaid, for he ſeldom Quotes them True, or what himſelf ſays, who cou'd write nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Senſe</hi> nor <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But here you ſee he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95758:42"/>Denies nothing of Mr. <hi>Skipp</hi>'s Charge againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but rather <hi>Juſtify's</hi> and <hi>Defends</hi> it, in other words, that we muſt ſuffer as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, till the <hi>Seed of God come from under the Power of Wickedneſs,</hi> which are almoſt Mr. <hi>Skipp</hi>'s own words. And <hi>Fox</hi> do's not Deny, that they Place the <hi>Meritorious</hi> Cauſe of ther <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> in thoſe <hi>Sufferings</hi> within <hi>themſelves,</hi> and not in the <hi>outward</hi> Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And that when theſe <hi>Inward Sufferings</hi> in their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences</hi> are over, and the <hi>Seed</hi> Purged, then that ther is an End of <hi>Hell,</hi> that theſe <hi>Sufferings</hi> of the <hi>Seed</hi> in them, is the only <hi>Hell,</hi> this <hi>Fox</hi> do's not <hi>Deny,</hi> tho poſitively Charg'd upon them: Which is a Plain <hi>Confeſſing;</hi> The Leaſt one can do is to <hi>Deny</hi> (as <hi>G. W.</hi> here, in. this <hi>Anſwer</hi> of his) But when we Pretend to <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and dare not ſo much as Plead <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> it is a full and total yielding to the <hi>Charge.</hi> The truth is, the <hi>Light within</hi> is All things to the <hi>Quakers</hi> its <hi>Shining</hi> (as they <hi>think</hi> they are <hi>ſure</hi>) within them, they call <hi>Heaven,</hi> its being <hi>obſcur'd,</hi> that is <hi>Hell;</hi> And they Believe no other <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> but their <hi>Light within.</hi> And when they are <hi>Poſſeſt</hi> with their <hi>Quaking</hi> Fits, they call it the <hi>Fighting</hi> of their <hi>Light within</hi> againſt their <hi>Darkneſs within;</hi> which <hi>G. W.</hi> wou'd turn off here upon <hi>Convulſion</hi> Fits. For which I leave him to be Chaſtis'd by thoſe <hi>Quakers</hi> who have wrote <hi>Apologies</hi> for their <hi>Quaking,</hi> as being the Effects of a <hi>Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration:</hi> And thoſe who were much troubl'd, becauſe that Extraordinary <hi>Quaking</hi> had now, in a Great meaſure, left them, as if thereby they had Loſt that Meaſure of the <hi>Spirit</hi> which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95758:42"/>their <hi>Fathers</hi> Poſſeſt, or which <hi>Poſſeſt</hi> their <hi>Fathers.</hi> To Comfort whom <hi>Pat. Levingſton</hi> wrote a Book call'd <hi>Plain and down right Dealing,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he told them that their firſt years were <hi>Purging</hi> years; but that when <hi>Phiſick</hi> had <hi>Purg'd</hi> ſufficiently, then the <hi>Patient</hi> was more <hi>Still</hi> and <hi>Quiet</hi> (See the <hi>Sn.</hi> p. 295.) yes, <hi>George,</hi> and after <hi>Convulſion-fits</hi> too when they are over! But, <hi>George,</hi> few <hi>Deſire</hi> fits of <hi>Convulſion</hi> or any <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Diſeaſe, and <hi>Long</hi> for them, as the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> for their <hi>Poſſeſſions:</hi> None Expreſs <hi>Exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> of <hi>Joy</hi> in <hi>Natural Diſeaſes,</hi> as we have heard of this <hi>Quaker Sickneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all this cou'd not be <hi>Counterfited:</hi> for None can <hi>Counterfit</hi> ſuch violent <hi>Convulſions</hi> and <hi>Diſtortions</hi> as Exceed the Power of <hi>Nature.</hi> In the Next Place <hi>Young Children</hi> among the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> were often feiz'd with theſe <hi>Quaking</hi> Fits, and theſe cou'd not <hi>Counterfit.</hi> And many Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly Deſir'd them, but cou'd not have them when they wou'd.</p>
               <p>And ſince they are neither <hi>Natural</hi> nor <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfit,</hi> they muſt be a <hi>Praeter Natural</hi> either <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> or <hi>Diabolical Poſſeſſion:</hi> And which of the two it is, ther are ſome Rules whereby to Gueſs, which are Mention'd in the <hi>Sn.</hi> Sect. xxi. which <hi>G. W.</hi> wou'd do well to Conſider, and not Shuffle them off as he do's in this <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he gives up the Cauſe, by Aſſigning ſuch Contradictory Reaſons: for, in the ſame breath, within the Compaſs of one <hi>Page</hi> he makes three <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> for theſe <hi>Quakings.</hi> Firſt, <hi>The word and Power of God.</hi> Second, <hi>Convulſion-Fits.</hi> Third, <hi>Exorciſm,</hi> or the <hi>Caſting out</hi> of <hi>ſome Evil Spirit.</hi> If he had ſaid the <hi>Entrance</hi> of the <hi>Evil Spirit,</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:95758:43"/>and its taking of <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> he had come nearer the Mark. But however, Why do's he make ſo many Gueſſes at the Cauſes of this <hi>Quaking?</hi> Did he not know whether it was <hi>Convulſion,</hi> or <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> or <hi>Exorciſm?</hi> or was he Aſham'd to tell?</p>
               <p>Well, but as to our Preſent purpoſe, from whatever Cauſe theſe <hi>Quakings</hi> do Proceed, it is allow'd on all hands that the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Strong;</hi> and carries with it the moſt viſible Effects of <hi>Madneſs.</hi> And as the Old <hi>Proverb</hi> ſays, <hi>Once Mad, and Ever the worſe,</hi> ſo they who have been once <hi>Poſſeſs'd</hi> with theſe <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Fits,</hi> ſeldom Ever after recover the ſtate they were in before, but have <hi>Raz'd Looks,</hi> and ſomething <hi>Frightful</hi> about them.</p>
               <p>But it is not all the <hi>Quakers</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> has Deliver'd ſo far into the Power of the <hi>Devil:</hi> And others have been <hi>Poſſeſs'd</hi> as well as the <hi>Quakers:</hi> But this was more Peculiar to the <hi>Quakers</hi> than to any others of any ſort of People; otherwiſe they had not got the Name of <hi>Quakers</hi> from thence. And at the time when the <hi>Devil</hi> was moſt Buſie, and theſe <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings</hi> were moſt <hi>Violent,</hi> and moſt <hi>Frequent,</hi> about the year 1653, <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> was then but very young, only <hi>three</hi> years old; and the <hi>Quakers</hi> did not then bear Proportion of <hi>One</hi> to a <hi>Thouſand</hi> (ſpeaking within Compaſs) to the Reſt of <hi>England:</hi> ſo that we have had a <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi> of theſe ſort of <hi>Mad-Men</hi> among the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> for <hi>One</hi> any where elſe. And if we Reckon thoſe <hi>Mad,</hi> who Defend the <hi>Madneſs</hi> of others, then very Few of the <hi>Quakers</hi> will be left out of this <hi>Claſſis</hi> of <hi>Mad-Men.</hi> But I wou'd Deſire
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95758:43"/>them, in their <hi>Lucid Intervals,</hi> to Conſider that <hi>God</hi> was in the <hi>ſmall ſtill voice,</hi> not in the Furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Wind, Earth-Quake,</hi> or <hi>Fire.</hi> It was the <hi>Evil-Spirits</hi> who <hi>Tore</hi> thoſe that they <hi>Poſſeſs'd,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I <hi>Kings</hi> xix.</note> and put them into <hi>Convulſions, Foaming, wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Roaring</hi>— It is ſaid of thoſe who heard the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that ſome <hi>Smote their Breaſts</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,</hi> others ſearch'd the <hi>Scriptures</hi> dayly, to find whether theſe things, which they Preach'd, were ſo. But can the <hi>Quakers</hi> give one Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Inſtance of any that was ever Converted to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> at this <hi>Frightful Hideous</hi> Rate! Do not ſuch <hi>Violent</hi> Tranſports look like the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Furie</hi> and <hi>Madneſs,</hi> more than of <hi>Meekneſs, Love, Humility,</hi> or any of the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Graces! And then if we look into the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Hereſies</hi> which were Taught by this <hi>Quaker Spirit,</hi> it makes it a full Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration what ſort of <hi>Spirit</hi> it was; and whence that <hi>Convulſive Birth</hi> of <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> did proceed: And that their <hi>Madneſs</hi> was not Cauſed by any <hi>Ordinary</hi> or <hi>Natural</hi> Diſtemper of <hi>Brain;</hi> but (which is much more <hi>Lamentable</hi> and <hi>Diſmal</hi>) by the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of <hi>Evil Spirits.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>G. W's.</hi> putting this off with <hi>Convulſion-Fits,</hi> may be Compar'd to that of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s <hi>Fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Sickneſs;</hi> who pretended that at thoſe times the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> came with <hi>Revelations</hi> to him. But if <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s <hi>Convulſions</hi> came from his <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> his caſe and the <hi>Quakers</hi> are as near of Kin as their <hi>Doctrin:</hi> For <hi>Mahomet</hi> Pretended to Reverence the <hi>Scriptures</hi> both of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New-Teſtament;</hi> only his <hi>Light within</hi> Guided him to <hi>Mis-underſtand</hi> them as to the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Incarnation:</hi> And his <hi>Alcoran</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:95758:44"/>is nearer the <hi>Quaker</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Comment upon the <hi>Text,</hi> than any other can be found in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It has been obſerv'd that the Beginnings of ſeveral <hi>Hereſies</hi> and <hi>Sects</hi> have been Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe ſort of <hi>Violent</hi> and <hi>Preternatural Tranſports,</hi> as in <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden, Knipperdolling,</hi> and ſome later <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> among our ſelves, beſides the <hi>Quakers.</hi> Such Puniſhments did in the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church often follow the ſentence of <hi>Excommunication</hi> upon Notorious offenders. And God has, in our Later times, which have learn'd to Diſpiſe thoſe <hi>Spiritual Cenſures,</hi> Inflicted the like upon thoſe who have <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd themſelves</hi> unto <hi>Satan,</hi> by <hi>Excommunicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> themſelves, in Forſaking the <hi>Church,</hi> and and making <hi>Schiſms</hi> againſt Her. Of theſe ſome notice may, perhaps, be taken hereafter. But this Inſtance of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is as Notorious as any, of the Power given to the <hi>Devil</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Hereſy-Archs.</hi> And I will not now take any others under conſideration, my preſent buſineſs being only with the <hi>Quakers.</hi>

Ther is mention'd a Declaration <hi>Sign'd</hi> by above <hi>Seven Thouſand</hi> of the <hi>Quakers, Aboliſhing</hi> all the <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Damning</hi> the <hi>Law-Makers,</hi> who Enact <hi>Tythes,</hi> the <hi>Payers</hi> of them, the <hi>Receivers,</hi> or any who but <hi>Countenance</hi> or <hi>Own</hi> them. This was in the year 1659. At which time the <hi>Quakers</hi> were very Buſie with their <hi>Propoſals</hi> to oppoſe the Reſtoration of the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>King. Rob. Rich,</hi>

                  </note> a <hi>Quaker</hi> tells Us of two other <hi>Printed Papers</hi> of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that ſame year, one ſubſcrib'd by <hi>more than Ten Thouſand,</hi> and the other by <hi>More than Fifteen Thouſand. All preſented to the then Parliament.</hi> To whom I am Credibly Inform'd, They offer'd to Raiſe <hi>Twenty Thouſand</hi> Men, againſt the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy,</hi> ſo they Term'd the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Loyal</hi> Party. And they had then ſo much Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, That, as the above Author Informs us (And cannot Deceive Us in that) by the <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> bearing Date the 28 <hi>June</hi> 1659 for <hi>Setling the Militia,</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> were made <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> to Form <hi>Troops</hi> and <hi>Regiments,</hi> to Nominate the <hi>Officers,</hi> and to Aſſeſs Money for Buying <hi>Horſe, Arms,</hi> &amp;c.

But that is not the Buſineſs now. We have ſufficient Teſtimony of their Firmneſs to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Royal</hi> Intereſt, at that Time! That which I wou'd Reaſon with them now upon, is, Their <hi>Annulling</hi> of our <hi>Laws</hi> (as of <hi>Tythes</hi>) <hi>Not being Lawfully Authoriz'd ſo to do.</hi> Their ſetting up, <hi>Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly Synods,</hi> or <hi>Parliaments;</hi> wherein they Iſſue <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</hi> By theſe <hi>Voluntary Taxes,</hi> per <hi>Force,</hi> they have Fill'd and Maintain a <hi>Treaſury,</hi> or <hi>Publick Stock;</hi> to Carry on their Common Cauſe: Among other things, to enable any Poor <hi>Friend,</hi> to ſupport a <hi>Law-Suite</hi> againſt the <hi>Prieſts</hi> for <hi>Tythes.</hi> Of which ſeveral Inſtances can be given. That theſe <hi>Baals-Prieſts,</hi> may have no other Choice, but either to Looſe the <hi>Tythes</hi> of the <hi>Quakers</hi> or Pay more for them, than they are worth. Eſpecially the <hi>Poorer</hi> ſort of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who are Eaſily Tyr'd out at Law: Unleſs they had ſuch a <hi>Fund</hi> as the <hi>Quakers</hi> have to ſupport them.</p>
               <p>Let me Entertain the Reader with one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, upon this Head, which happen'd Lately: And has Conduc'd to open the Eyes of ſome Deluded <hi>Quakers,</hi> particularly of <hi>William Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> who writes the Account himſelf, by his Letters, Dated from <hi>Bedford</hi> 12. <hi>July.</hi> 1698: And tells, That one <hi>Joſeph Clark,</hi> a <hi>Quaker Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi> being ſued for his <hi>Tythe</hi> by the <hi>Prieſt, John Feild,</hi> an <hi>Eminent</hi> London <hi>Quaker Preacher,</hi> and one of the Principal <hi>Directors</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Second-Days-Meeting;</hi> which is the <hi>Helme</hi> of the whole <hi>Quaker Government;</hi> it is the <hi>Conclave,</hi> which <hi>Preſeribes</hi> even to their <hi>General Council,</hi> the <hi>Yearly Meeting</hi> at <hi>London;</hi> and which is more, Commands their <hi>Bank</hi> or <hi>Publick Treaſury;</hi> This <hi>John Field</hi> Encourag'd <hi>Joſeph Clark</hi> to ſtand
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95758:50"/>out the <hi>Suite</hi> with the <hi>Prieſt;</hi> and Promis'd to ſecure his <hi>Goods</hi> from the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> if it came to the worſt.

               </p>
               <p>But it is the <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and not the <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> of their Practice herein that I am now upon.

And this <hi>Quaker</hi> whom I am ſpeaking of, taking his opponent <hi>Smith</hi> to be well Inclin'd towards the <hi>Royal</hi> Cauſe, and having him in the <hi>Mayor</hi>'s Houſe, he broke off from the Subject of <hi>Religion</hi> they were met about; and Demanded of him, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he owned his Brethren the Prieſts, who had ſo much ſtirred up the</hi> Rebellion <hi>againſt the preſent Government?</hi> To which Inſnaring Queſtion, the <hi>Quaker</hi> ſays, <hi>Smith</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>That he did not own them.</hi> But that was (ſaid the Quaker) <hi>becauſe he ſaw they did not Proſper in their Deſigns.</hi> But when they did Proſper, as they did the year following, then the <hi>Quakers</hi> were the only <hi>Royal</hi> and <hi>Loyal</hi> Party! and ſaid they had been ſo all along! And accus'd theſe ſame <hi>Profeſſors</hi> (as they call'd the <hi>Presbyterians, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> &amp;c.) that they had been the <hi>King's</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and therefore not fit to be Truſted by Him, or to be ſuffer'd to <hi>Teach</hi> the People. as ſhewn in the <hi>Sn.</hi> Sect. xviii.</p>

Which he further Explains, p. 33. in theſe words, <hi>Now the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Do Expreſly Diſtinguiſh between</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and the</hi> Garment <hi>which He</hi> wore; <hi>between</hi> Him <hi>that Came, and the</hi> Body <hi>in which He came; between the</hi> Subſtance <hi>which was Vailed, and the</hi> Vaile <hi>which Vailed it.</hi> Lo I come, a Body haſt thou Prepared Me. <hi>There is Plainly</hi> He, <hi>and the</hi> Body <hi>in which He came. Ther was the</hi> outward Veſſel, <hi>and the</hi> Inward Life. <hi>This we certainly know, and can never call the</hi> Bodily <hi>Garment,</hi> Chriſt, <hi>but that which Appeared and Dwelt in the Body.</hi> So that by this, <hi>Jeſus was</hi> not the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> only the <hi>Prepared Body, Garment,</hi> or <hi>Vaile</hi> in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> Dwelt.

The <hi>Body</hi> was the <hi>Son's,</hi> as a man's <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or <hi>Vaile</hi> is his who <hi>owns</hi> and <hi>wears</hi> it; as the <hi>Body;</hi> of <hi>Will. Penn</hi> is the <hi>Son's</hi> who (he ſuppoſes) Dwells in it: But the <hi>Son</hi> was not the <hi>Body,</hi> that is, <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in whoſe Body <hi>Chriſt</hi> Dwelt, was not the <hi>Son,</hi> not <hi>Properly</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> but in a Large ſenſe, as other men are call'd the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And <hi>Chriſt</hi> Suffer'd His <hi>Garment</hi> or <hi>Vaile,</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to be <hi>Crucifi'd: But that the outward Perſon which ſuffer'd, was Properly the Son of God,</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> do <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Deny.</hi> And as that <hi>Perſon</hi> which <hi>Suffer'd</hi> was not <hi>Properly</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> it follows as certainly that the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was not <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> that <hi>Perſon,</hi> or was not <hi>Properly</hi> a <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Meaning of <hi>Will. Penn,</hi> in his <hi>Sandy Foundation.</hi> p. 20. calling <hi>Chriſt</hi> a <hi>Finit, Impotent Creature.</hi> He did not mean the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal word.</hi> Or that this <hi>Word</hi> was <hi>Properly</hi> a <hi>Man</hi> in <hi>our Nature;</hi> for then, tho' the <hi>Manhood</hi> was a <hi>Creature,</hi> and <hi>Finit,</hi> yet the <hi>Man,</hi> or <hi>Perſon</hi> was not ſo. As a Man's <hi>Body</hi> is <hi>Corruptible,</hi> yet the <hi>Perſon</hi> Conſiſting of <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> is not ſo. Tho' the <hi>Properties</hi> of Each <hi>Nature,</hi> whereof a <hi>Perſon</hi> do's Conſiſt, may be Attributed to the <hi>Perſon;</hi> as a <hi>Man</hi> is ſaid to <hi>Dye,</hi> to <hi>Eat, Drink, Sleep</hi> &amp;c. tho' theſe are Proper only to the <hi>Body:</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:95758:57"/>And likewiſe he is ſaid to <hi>Think,</hi> to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> to be <hi>Immortal,</hi> tho' theſe are <hi>Proper</hi> only to his <hi>Soul.</hi> Thus <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to <hi>Dye,</hi> to ſhed His <hi>Blood</hi> &amp;c. tho' this be Proper only to the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> which the <hi>Word</hi> aſſum'd into His own <hi>Perſon:</hi> And <hi>Man</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>God, Infinit, Almighty</hi> &amp;c. tho' this be Proper only to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is likewiſe Truly and Properly a <hi>Man.</hi> And none who had a True Notion of this, cou'd ever have brought himſelf, to call <hi>Chriſt,</hi> a <hi>Finit, Impotent Creature.</hi> Such a Blaſphemous Contempt of our B. <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> cou'd never have Dropt from the Pen of a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> But upon <hi>Will. Penn</hi>'s Scheme, that the <hi>Word</hi> was not <hi>Properly a Man,</hi> it muſt follow, that the <hi>Perſon</hi> who <hi>Suffer'd</hi> was not <hi>Properly</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> And Conſequently that the <hi>Perſon</hi> who <hi>Suffer'd,</hi> which is the Chriſtians <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was but a <hi>Finit Impotent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and not <hi>Truly</hi> and <hi>Properly</hi> the <hi>Chriſt. J. Pennington</hi> aſſerts that the Name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not belong to the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which he calls only the <hi>Veſſel,</hi> or <hi>Vaile</hi> (as in his <hi>Queſt. to Profeſſors.</hi> p. 25.) but only to the <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> which Dwelt in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as in the <hi>Quakers: So that the Name</hi> (<hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſays he) <hi>is not given to the Veſſel, but to the Nature, to the Heavenly Treaſure, to that which is of him In the Veſſel.</hi> And he Contends That <hi>it was not the Fleſh and Blood of the Vaile</hi> which was the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> that <hi>Cleanſes.</hi> i. e. not the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but <hi>The Fleſh and Blood within the Vaile.</hi> i. e. the <hi>Spiritual Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of their <hi>Light within.</hi> Not the <hi>Fleſh and Blood</hi> (ſays he) <hi>of the outward Earthly Nature;</hi> but <hi>the Fleſh and Blood of the Inward
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95758:57"/>Spiritual Nature:</hi> Not the <hi>Fleſh and Blood which Chriſt took of the firſt Adam's Nature; but the Fleſh and Blood of the Second Adam's Nature.</hi> And <hi>What is the Laver of Regeneration</hi> (ſays he p. 24.) <hi>wherewith the Soul is waſhed? Is it the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which ran out of the ſide of the Natural Body, when it was Pierced with a Spear? or the Water which floweth from the Spirit?</hi> And <hi>Can outward Blood Cleanſe the Conſcience?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>G. W.</hi> is not againſt telling the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that is, as he puts the <hi>Caveat, Truly Conſider'd,</hi> i. e. ſo as not to lay the ſtreſs of our <hi>Salvation</hi> upon <hi>Faith</hi> in thoſe <hi>outward Sufferings,</hi> or to make that <hi>Neceſſary</hi> to us: That <hi>Prerogative</hi> they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve only for the <hi>Sufferings, Blood-ſhedding</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>Their Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Light within.</hi> That only is <hi>ſufficient</hi> without <hi>any thing elſe.</hi> And <hi>when you come to this</hi> (ſay they, in a Book Intituled <hi>The Doctrin of Perfection vindicated.</hi> Printed 1663. p. 19.) <hi>you will ceaſe Remembring His Death at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and will come to ſee how He hath been Crucify'd In you</hi> &amp;c. His <hi>outward Death</hi> is to be <hi>Forgotten;</hi> for the ſtreſs do's not Ly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that! And, as Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> ſays in his <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm a new nick-name</hi> &amp;c. p. 12. <hi>Since they believe that appearance</hi> (of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Fleſh</hi> at Jeruſalem) <hi>they need not Preach what is not to be again.</hi> (See <hi>Satan Dis-Rob'd.</hi> p. 11.) Ther is an End of any more <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Faith</hi> in that! Nay, it do's <hi>Hurt,</hi> as taking men off from Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting <hi>wholey</hi> and <hi>ſoley</hi> in the <hi>Light within</hi> as ſufficient <hi>without it!</hi> Which is the very <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> of the <hi>Quaker-Faith.</hi> And therefore they think the <hi>Heathen</hi> in a Better Condition
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95758:58"/>than thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who lay ſo much ſtreſs upon the <hi>outward Chriſt,</hi> His <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings;</hi> for that the <hi>Heathen</hi> have not that <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrance</hi> to Divert them from Truſting <hi>wholly</hi> to their <hi>Light within,</hi> and to <hi>nothing elſe.</hi> And they think the <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>outward Chriſt</hi> ſo very Deſtructive, that <hi>G.

And that <hi>by his Spiritual Influences, He is in all His Saints,</hi> p. 7. That <hi>He is Dwelling in the Believers Heart, by Faith of and in Him,</hi> p. 19. — <hi>And from thence the Saints are ſaid to be the Habitation of God through the Spirit,</hi> p. 36. And much more to the ſame Purpoſe. But all this <hi>Faith</hi> is built upon the <hi>outward Chriſt,</hi> His <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> without <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s:</hi> And therefore <hi>G. Fox</hi> wrote an Anſwer to this Book, in his <hi>Great Myſtery.</hi> p. 246. And Replies thus upon <hi>Wade.</hi> p. 250. <hi>And the Devil was in thee, and thou ſaith thou art ſaved by Chriſt without thee, and ſo hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded thy ſelf to be a Reprobate, and Ignorant of the Myſtery of Chriſt within thee.</hi> So that, by this Doctrin, to believe in a <hi>Chriſt without,</hi> is
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95758:59"/>to be Poſſeſs'd with the <hi>Devil,</hi> to be a <hi>Reprobate,</hi> and Ignorant of <hi>Chriſt within.</hi> For they make to be theſe <hi>Two Chriſt's,</hi> as they objected againſt <hi>G.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95758:61"/>means that this cou'd not be the <hi>outward-Fleſh:</hi> But that it was the <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Fleſh</hi> before ſpoke of; Which the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſuppoſe that they have <hi>within</hi> them; and this is it which they call their <hi>Light within.</hi> But I will Anſwer this <hi>Quere</hi> of <hi>G.

Therefore I ſay, That it was <hi>Human Blood</hi> of which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid <hi>Except a man drink of it</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>And now what do's it ſignifie to bring <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> out of the <hi>Quaker</hi> Books, which ſpeak of the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and bear witneſs to it, while they mean not <hi>Real</hi> or <hi>Human Blood,</hi> of <hi>our Nature,</hi> but only the <hi>Inward</hi> Spiritual <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in our <hi>Hearts;</hi> And do not Diſtinguiſh this at all from His <hi>Blood?</hi> As <hi>G.

               <p>Thus <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 62. <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> brings in <hi>C.

Thus the <hi>Legal Sacrifices</hi> were <hi>Types,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Archi-Type;</hi> not as <hi>G. W.</hi> wou'd have it, that He was the <hi>Chief-Type</hi> of <hi>Himſelf.</hi> And hence the <hi>Quakers</hi> making the <hi>outward-Chriſt</hi> a <hi>Type</hi> of their <hi>Light within,</hi> gives <hi>That</hi> the Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and makes Chriſt <hi>Inferior</hi> to <hi>It.</hi> (See
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95758:64"/>
                  <hi>Sat. Dis.</hi> Sect. 2. N. v. p. 34). Will he ſay the <hi>Light-within</hi> is an <hi>Allegorie?</hi> if not, then, in his ſenſe of it, he plainly Prefers it to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And makes <hi>Chriſt,</hi> His <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>outward Blood</hi> to Refer to It. He <hi>Confeſſes</hi> while he <hi>Denies!</hi> He wou'd avoid the Charge of making <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Blood</hi> an <hi>Allegorie,</hi> and yet he Expreſly calls it an <hi>Allegorie;</hi> i. e. that it has an <hi>Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Meaning;</hi> for that is the only way that any thing can be call'd an <hi>Allegorie.</hi> But what the <hi>Quakers</hi> call the <hi>Spiritual Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they will not let that be an <hi>Allegorie,</hi> or have any thing elſe to Refer to, for then it wou'd not be the <hi>Chief</hi> and <hi>Principal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in this (as in other things) have lighted upon the Direct <hi>Contrary</hi> to the <hi>Truth;</hi> for whatever it may be which they Dream by <hi>Spiritual Blood,</hi> that can be only <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical</hi> to the <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>Real Blood.</hi> For let me ask, whether the <hi>Blood</hi> of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> i. e. of their <hi>Light within,</hi> be not an <hi>Allegorical</hi> Expreſſion? But they will have the <hi>outward Blood</hi> of an <hi>Humane Body</hi> to paſs for an <hi>Allegorie. For all that is ſpoken of the Blood of Chriſt in Scripture</hi> (ſays <hi>G. W. ibid.</hi>) <hi>is not to be taken only in a Literal Senſe.</hi> Here is an <hi>only</hi> again, to put us off from knowing of his Meaning. <hi>Not</hi> only <hi>in a Literal Senſe!</hi> (The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are but <hi>Dunces</hi> to theſe <hi>Quakers,</hi> for <hi>Plainneſs</hi> and <hi>Sincerity!</hi>) If the <hi>Efficacy</hi> and <hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> do Extend to any <hi>Spiritual</hi> Effects, by <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Him,</hi> His <hi>Death</hi> and the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> thereby Made for our <hi>Sins,</hi> then <hi>G. W.</hi> thinks to come off by his word <hi>only,</hi> that the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not to be taken
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95758:65"/>
                  <hi>only</hi> in a <hi>Literal Senſe:</hi> And then it muſt be an <hi>Allegorie!</hi> And ſo he has gain'd his Point. But <hi>(George!)</hi> all this do's not make it an <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie,</hi> nor hinder <hi>all that is ſpoken of the Blood of Chriſt in Scripture to be taken in a Literal Senſe,</hi> and (notwithſtanding of Thy <hi>only</hi>) I will ſay <hi>only</hi> in a <hi>Literal</hi> Senſe: for <hi>outward Blood</hi> is <hi>only</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Blood,</hi> and not <hi>Spiritual</hi> Blood: And its having <hi>Spiritual Effects,</hi> do's, in no ways, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its being <hi>only</hi> outward <hi>Blood:</hi> nor do's it make ſuch <hi>Blood</hi> to be any <hi>Allegorie</hi> at all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Legal Sacrifices,</hi> it have Reſpect to another <hi>Blood</hi> more <hi>Worthy</hi> and <hi>Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> than it ſelf: for <hi>Allegorie,</hi> in this Diſpute, means the ſame as <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure.</hi> Thus <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. 24, <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael, Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar</hi> are call'd an <hi>Allegorie,</hi> becauſe they were a <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of the Two <hi>Covenants.</hi> And thus it is that the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> wou'd have the <hi>outward Chriſt</hi> to be an <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie, Sc.</hi> of what they call the <hi>Inward Chriſt</hi> or <hi>Light within;</hi> which they make the <hi>Archi-Type,</hi> and ſo of more <hi>Worth</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> than the <hi>outward Chriſt,</hi> and conſequently the <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> by which we are ſav'd to be Referr'd to <hi>That,</hi> and not to the <hi>outward Chriſt,</hi> who was but the <hi>Allegory, Type,</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of <hi>It.</hi> And this totally throws off the <hi>outward Chriſt</hi> from having any <hi>Share</hi> or <hi>Parcel</hi> in our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> more than the <hi>Blood</hi> of thoſe <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Goats</hi> which were <hi>Sacrific'd</hi> under the <hi>Law;</hi> for the <hi>Quakers</hi> make the <hi>outward Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be but a <hi>Type,</hi> as theſe; tho a nearer <hi>Type</hi> than theſe: But All is to be Referr'd into the <hi>Archi-Type,</hi> which they make to be the <hi>Light within.</hi> When the <hi>Archi-Type</hi> comes, <hi>All Types</hi> of it do va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and become of no more Effect at all: Nay, it
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95758:65"/>is a <hi>Sin</hi> to uſe them any more, for that is an Implicit Denying of the <hi>Archi-Types</hi> being come: And hence it is, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are ſo Enrag'd againſt laying any ſtreſs upon the <hi>outward Chriſt,</hi> His <hi>Death</hi> or <hi>Sufferings</hi> without <hi>us;</hi> which they ſay (as before Quoted) need not <hi>now</hi> be <hi>Preach'd,</hi> becauſe <hi>they are not to be again.</hi> i. e. They are <hi>Paſt;</hi> but the <hi>Archi-Type,</hi> the <hi>Light within</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, which is <hi>Sufficient</hi> of it ſelf, and without <hi>any thing elſe.</hi> i. e. without the <hi>outward Death</hi> of a <hi>Chriſt</hi> without <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> For this <hi>Inward Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Light within</hi> was always, before the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of the <hi>outward Chriſt;</hi> And before that (ſay the <hi>Quakers</hi>) did ſhed its <hi>Spiritual Blood</hi> &amp;c. which was <hi>Sufficient</hi> to <hi>Save</hi> us: And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ther was no need of the <hi>outward Chriſt</hi>'s coming at all: as now the ſtreſs is not to be laid upon it, but upon the <hi>Light within,</hi> which is <hi>Sufficient</hi> without <hi>It.</hi> This is the true <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Doctrin.</hi> But how the <hi>outward Chriſt</hi> cou'd be a <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Inward Chriſt</hi> or <hi>Light within,</hi> which was <hi>Before</hi> Him, the <hi>Quakers</hi> are left to Explain; for a <hi>Type</hi> muſt be <hi>Before</hi> that of which it is the <hi>Type,</hi> elſe it were not a <hi>Type,</hi> which is a <hi>Fore-runner</hi> of it. But <hi>Contradictions</hi> are no <hi>Novelties</hi> with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. W.</hi> falls again upon this Topick, p. 39. And takes a new way, thus ſays he, <hi>We know not what Author he has for this Charge,</hi> as if none of their Authors had been Quoted in the <hi>Sn.</hi> where <hi>Sect.</hi> x. the Reader will find Quotations ſufficient, all of which <hi>G.

But, in this ſame place where he makes this Excuſe, he do's himſelf <hi>Confeſs</hi> what is <hi>Charg'd</hi> upon them: for he ſays Expreſly, That <hi>Chriſt's</hi> outward <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> which flow'd out of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95758:66"/>
                  <hi>His Side, had an</hi> Allegorical <hi>Signification, even</hi> (ſays he) <hi>of the Spiritual Blood and Water of Life</hi> &amp;c. Now (as before is ſaid) having an <hi>Allegorical</hi> ſignification, is all that makes any thing to be an <hi>Allegorie.</hi> And making the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be an <hi>Allegorie,</hi> that makes it but a <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure;</hi> and <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> gives the Preference to whatever they <hi>Fancie</hi> by <hi>Inward Body</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi> The Queſtion being put to <hi>George Fox,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Whether Chriſt in the Fleſh be a Figure or not?</hi> He An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in his <hi>Saul's Errand.</hi> p. 14. <hi>His Fleſh is a Figure.</hi> And p. 8. It being objected againſt <hi>Richard Hubberthorn,</hi> that he had <hi>wrote,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>That Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh, was But a Figure. G. Fox</hi> Defends that ſaying, thus, <hi>Chriſt, in his People, is the Subſtance of all Figures-but as He is held forth in the Scripture-Letter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, and in the Fleſh without them, He is their Example or Figure, which is both one, that the ſame things might be fullfill'd in Them, that was in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Here he ſays that <hi>Example</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> are both <hi>one.</hi> For he Underſtood not <hi>Words</hi> or the <hi>Senſe</hi> of them; therefore you muſt take his Meaning, as he Expreſſes it, and by <hi>Example</hi> mean <hi>Figure.</hi> And here you ſee he makes a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>His People,</hi> and as in the <hi>Fleſh</hi> without <hi>them.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> is that <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Fleſh</hi> before ſpoke of, or their <hi>Light within:</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> is the <hi>outward Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> he makes the <hi>Subſtance</hi> and no <hi>Figure:</hi> but the <hi>Second</hi> he Expreſly calls a <hi>Figure.</hi> And of what is it the <hi>Figure?</hi> He tells, of <hi>the ſame things to be fulfill'd in Them, that was in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> That is the <hi>Atonement</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> made for <hi>Sin</hi> was not the <hi>outward</hi> ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95758:66"/>of His <hi>Blood,</hi> but the ſhedding of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Blood <hi>Inwardly:</hi> And that this is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd <hi>in Them,</hi> as it was <hi>in Chriſt;</hi> And that the <hi>Atonement</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is made <hi>in Them,</hi> and <hi>The ſame</hi> in <hi>Them</hi> that was in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This <hi>Inward</hi> Atonement they make the Great <hi>Myſtery,</hi> of which <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s outward <hi>Sufferings</hi> were but the <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> expreſſes it, in his <hi>Rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to <hi>John Faldo.</hi> p. 336. That theſe <hi>Transactions</hi> i. e. of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s outward <hi>Sufferings</hi> were <hi>as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> Facile Repreſentations <hi>of what is to be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd In Man.</hi> (See <hi>Sat.

Fox</hi>'s <hi>Sauls Errand</hi> are Produc'd (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many others) in the <hi>Sn.</hi> yet <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> crys, <hi>We know not what Author he has for this Charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ther is another Little <hi>Author</hi> which <hi>G. W.</hi> has Forgot (it were well for him if he cou'd) who Anſwers to the ſame Objection that was put to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> ſix years after the Anſwer before Quoted given to it by <hi>G. F.</hi> in his <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Errand,</hi> which was Printed <hi>An.</hi> 1653. But <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s <hi>Truth defending the Quakers</hi> was Printed <hi>An.</hi> 1659. where p. 20. he Anſwers to the ſame objection, which he ſets down in theſe words, <hi>Did</hi> Richard Hubberthorn <hi>well in writing That Chriſt's Coming in the Fleſh was but a Figure?</hi> And his Anſwer is <hi>Delicious!</hi> which therefore I will ſet down every word of it, and is as follows. <hi>Anſ. Cou'd Chriſt have been ſaid to have been</hi> Transfigured <hi>if his Coming in the Fleſh had not been a</hi> Figure <hi>or</hi> Example <hi>till his Glory was Revealed? And haſt thou not read that he was the</hi> Expreſs Figure of his Fathers Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance?
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95758:67"/>
                  <hi>inſtead of whih its tranſlated</hi> Image <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not but here as if ther were any More in his <hi>Anſwer,</hi> of which this is every word, and ends with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as I have ſet it down, leſt <hi>G. W.</hi> might have a Secret-Reſerve in that (who never writes without one) and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me of <hi>Falſe-Quotation,</hi> in leaving any thing out; after the Manner of his <hi>Appendix,</hi> as you will ſee hereafter in the Second <hi>Part.</hi> Sect. ii. N. 6. But now as to this <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Here <hi>G. W.</hi> do's not Deny that his Friend <hi>Hubberthorn</hi> had wrote thus. Or, that this was the Current <hi>Doctrin</hi> of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and <hi>Juſtify'd</hi> by them. No, he owns all that, and go's on to Juſtify it, as <hi>Fox</hi> had done before him, and he had <hi>Six Years</hi> time after <hi>Fox</hi> had Anſwer'd, to have Conſider'd of it. But the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrin <hi>is the ſame it was from the Beginning!</hi> for <hi>Truth is one and Changes not!</hi> But the <hi>Wit</hi> ſometimes may. Of which <hi>G. W.</hi> here gives a noble Turn. He proves, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> was but a <hi>Figure,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He was <hi>Transfigured!</hi> This <hi>Punn</hi> looks as if it had been ſtolen out of <hi>Cambridge Jeſts.</hi> And I cou'd forgive <hi>George</hi> to Exert this <hi>Size</hi> of his <hi>Wit,</hi> were it not in <hi>Serious</hi> Matters. But to Pretend, That this was <hi>Written from the Spirit of Truth in</hi> George Whitehead <hi>and</hi> Geo. Fox <hi>the younger,</hi> as it is ſaid on the <hi>Title-Page</hi> of this Book; And p. 7. That it is <hi>of as Great Authority as the Scriptures, and Greater,</hi> this puts it paſt a <hi>Jeſt,</hi> and ought to be Animadverted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a moſt Outragious <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi> And ſhews moreover the <hi>Mad Deluſion</hi> of theſe <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they are out of their <hi>Wits,</hi> and their <hi>Brains</hi> turn'd by an <hi>Enthuſiaſtical Diſtraction.</hi> For, as
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95758:67"/>before has been ſhewn, the meaning of the word <hi>Figure</hi> in this Diſpute, is a <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Shadow,</hi> whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of ſomething elſe? i. e. of the <hi>Light</hi> within <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> And to Prove this, by the <hi>Figure,</hi> that is, the <hi>Shape</hi> or <hi>outward Appearance</hi> of His <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> and <hi>Raiment</hi> being <hi>Chang'd</hi> in His <hi>Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration</hi> upon the <hi>Mount,</hi> if theſe Men believe themſelves, is ſuch a Portion of <hi>Ignorance</hi> as ſets them not out of the Rank of <hi>Children:</hi> But their thinking it to be <hi>Divine Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> makes them <hi>Mad-Men,</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemouſly</hi> ſo. Then again, to make <hi>Figure,</hi> even in this ſenſe that they wou'd take it, to be the ſame as an <hi>Example,</hi> which is Expreſs'd in both the <hi>Anſwers</hi> of <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> this is not to know at all what they ſay, but to ſet down words at Random. For let Chriſts <hi>Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> be a <hi>Figure,</hi> in whatever ſenſe, yet how is it an <hi>Example</hi> to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s?</hi> Are we to be <hi>Transfigur'd,</hi> while upon <hi>Earth,</hi> as He was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Mount?</hi> And muſt the <hi>Cloaths</hi> we wear become <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Shining</hi> as His was then?</p>
               <p>Who wou'd have found fault with <hi>Hubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn</hi> for ſaying that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to be an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> to Us? Tho' the word <hi>But</hi> cou'd not have paſt even there. To ſay that <hi>Chriſts coming in the Fleſh</hi> was <hi>But</hi> an <hi>Example,</hi> as if it had been Intended for nothing elſe! And nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>G. F.</hi> nor <hi>G. W.</hi> find any fault with this <hi>But</hi> of <hi>Hubberthorn</hi>'s, tho' it was objected; but Juſtify <hi>Hubberthorn</hi> in the whole. For it is the very <hi>Quaker</hi> Doctrin. <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Birth, Sufferings,</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are but <hi>Types</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:95758:68"/>or <hi>Examples</hi> of all thoſe things to be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd more <hi>Eminently</hi> within <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s;</hi> what <hi>Chriſt</hi> Did or Suffer'd <hi>Outwardly,</hi> they make but the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and even <hi>Facile Repreſentations</hi> (as before has been ſaid) of <hi>what was to be Accompliſh'd in Man.</hi> Where the <hi>Atonement</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for <hi>Sin</hi> is made, by the <hi>Birth, Sufferings,</hi> &amp;c. of the <hi>Light within,</hi> and not by any thing which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffer'd <hi>Outwardly</hi> for Us. For that we muſt <hi>Suffer</hi> the ſame our ſelves, even <hi>Eternal Burnings,</hi> and are <hi>Juſtify'd</hi> only by what <hi>We</hi> ſuffer, or the <hi>Light</hi> ſuffers <hi>In</hi> us; And not by the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of any <hi>Chriſt</hi> without <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> as before ſhewn. <hi>p.</hi> 61. And this <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> wrought by the <hi>Light</hi> in our <hi>Hearts,</hi> they make to be a greater <hi>Myſtery</hi> than the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and His taking our <hi>Fleſh</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Him in the Womb of the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin;</hi> who (according to them) was But a <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of their <hi>Virgin</hi> Hearts, where the <hi>True Christ</hi> is <hi>Born,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But <hi>G. W.</hi> has another <hi>Text</hi> for his <hi>Figure,</hi> it is <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 3. where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>The Expreſs Image of His</hi> (Fathers) <hi>Perſon.</hi> Which <hi>G. W.</hi> will have render'd thus, <hi>The Expreſs Figure of his Fathers ſubſtance.</hi> He gives no <hi>Reaſon</hi> for the <hi>Fault</hi> he finds with our <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation.</hi> Yet, I ſuppoſe, he gave all he had. But however, what uſe can he make of it? That <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the <hi>Figure</hi> or <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>His</hi> Fathers <hi>Subſtance?</hi> what is the <hi>Example</hi> of a <hi>Subſtance?</hi> And was <hi>Chriſt</hi> an <hi>Example</hi> to His <hi>Father?</hi> Alas poor <hi>Quakers!</hi> Every thing goes wrong with them! But Purſue this <hi>Antidoie.</hi> G. W. ſays p. 39. That the <hi>Quakers</hi> do own that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>outward Blood is a Part of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95758:68"/>His Sacrifice. But (George)</hi> what <hi>Part</hi> is it? this was put in but to Amuſe. And by what is ſaid above, if it be a <hi>Type,</hi> tho' the <hi>Chief</hi> Type, it can be no <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> or <hi>Atonement:</hi> for, let me ask thee <hi>(George)</hi> Is not the <hi>Light</hi> within <hi>ſufficient</hi> without <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe?</hi> was ther no <hi>Atonement</hi> before <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſuffer'd under <hi>Pontius Pilate?</hi> or was it the Vertue of that <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> which did ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate backward to thoſe before Him, by <hi>Faith</hi> in Him who was to Come? or was ther then another <hi>Atonement</hi> before He came? if ſo, was not that Atonement <hi>Perfect?</hi> then the <hi>outward Blood</hi> was no Part of it. Or were ther <hi>Two</hi> Atonements? was that <hi>Firſt,</hi> which the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſuppoſe made by the <hi>Heavenly Body,</hi> which, as <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſays, was <hi>Crucified</hi> when <hi>Adam</hi> fell, was that <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> and <hi>Sufficient?</hi> If ſo, what needed Another? was the other which follow'd 4000 years after, any <hi>Part</hi> of it?

And, in favour to <hi>George,</hi> I paſs it without any Reply. Second Argument. <hi>He</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>as in Himſelf, is the Substance of all
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95758:69"/>Shadows, and the fulneſs of Light and Life.</hi> Who Doubts it <hi>George?</hi> But what <hi>Christ</hi> do'ſt thee mean? Thee ſay'ſt, <hi>As in Himſelf,</hi> did'ſt thee not mean by this, The <hi>Light within?</hi> yea ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily! then thy meaning is, that the <hi>Light within</hi> is the <hi>Substance of all Shadows.</hi> And this is the very thing that is Charg'd upon thee and thy fellow <hi>Quakers.</hi> Why did'ſt thee not ſay that the <hi>outward Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> who was <hi>Nail'd</hi> to the <hi>Croſs</hi> was the <hi>Substance of all Shadows?</hi> That wou'd have been ſpeaking Plain.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95758:69"/>for by this <hi>Body,</hi> they mean the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and by a <hi>Spiritual Body</hi> they mean nothing but <hi>Spirit.</hi> However this ſerves them to <hi>Dodge</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve</hi> others. It was to meet with them in this, that the <hi>Firſt</hi> and the <hi>Sixth Quaeres,</hi> of thoſe given to their <hi>Yearly Meeting.</hi> 1695. were fram'd. viz. <hi>Do you believe in a Chriſt</hi> without you, <hi>Now in Heaven?</hi> And <hi>Quaer.</hi> 6. <hi>Is Chriſt now at this Day, and for Ever to come, Truly and Really a</hi> Man, <hi>in true and Proper</hi> Human <hi>Nature,</hi> without <hi>all other Men?</hi> But in their Pretended <hi>Anſwer</hi> to theſe <hi>Quaeres,</hi> they wave Anſwering <hi>Directly,</hi> and leave out the words <hi>without us,</hi> and <hi>without all other Men,</hi> and the word <hi>Human,</hi> upon which the Chief ſtreſs was laid, becauſe they do believe that this <hi>Notional Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>within</hi> them, as well as His <hi>Spirit:</hi> Therefore they wou'd not Anſwer to this. And, tho' this was again Preſt upon them, in the <hi>Concluſion</hi> of the <hi>Sn.</hi> and they were told of all this <hi>Dodging,</hi> and this was put upon them, as a <hi>Criterion</hi> to Clear themſelves; and therefore they were Deſir'd to begin their <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> to the <hi>Sn.</hi> with a <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Direct</hi> Anſ. <hi>Yea,</hi> or <hi>Nay</hi> to theſe <hi>Two</hi> ſhort <hi>Queres.</hi> Yet no Provocation can bring them to it. They will not yet Anſwer to it; for it Diſcovers the <hi>Heart</hi> of their Cauſe. It wou'd totally overthrow their <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies,</hi> wherein they Deny, <hi>That Chriſt hath now a Body of Fleſh and Bones Circumſcript or Limited in that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven which is Above, and out of Every Man on Earth.</hi> Theſe are the words of <hi>John Whitehead,</hi> in his <hi>Quakers Refuge</hi> Printed 1673. p. 40.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95758:70"/>And p. 41. he ſays that they are in the Error who <hi>wou'd Limit it to a Particular Place, and out of every Man on Earth.</hi> for (ſays he) <hi>The Spirit and Body of Christ is not Divided; but whereſoever the Spirit and Life of Christ is, it is in the Body of Christ.</hi> This ſhews plainly what they mean. That the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is not <hi>Now</hi> a Body <hi>Circumſcript</hi> or <hi>Limited</hi> to any <hi>Place</hi> (and conſequently it is no <hi>Body</hi> at all, for that is <hi>Inſeperable</hi> from a <hi>Body</hi>) but that it is whereſoever His <hi>Spirit</hi> is, and that it is <hi>within</hi> them, and not <hi>without all other Men.</hi> Thus <hi>Edward Burough</hi> being De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, in theſe Poſitive Terms, <hi>Is that very man, with that very</hi> Body, <hi>within you, Yea, or Nay?</hi> And this he do's not at all <hi>Deny,</hi> but Anſwers in the <hi>Affirmative.</hi> p. 149. of his works. <hi>The very Chriſt of God is within us.</hi> You muſt take the meaning of theſe men by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that to which they Anſwer; and which they oppoſe: for in a Limited ſenſe, <hi>Christ,</hi> by His Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Influences,</hi> is <hi>within</hi> us; and <hi>Chriſt is The very Christ;</hi> ſo that ther is a ſenſe in which that Expreſſion (tho' offenſive in the wording of it) may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: But then when we conſider that which they <hi>Oppoſe,</hi> or to which they <hi>Anſwer,</hi> the meaning appears Plain. for why wou'd they <hi>Oppoſe</hi> what they thought <hi>Orthodox?</hi>

               <p>But to the Subject we are upon. The firſt Book he Anſwers in his <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> is of one of the then <hi>Ministers</hi> Mr. <hi>Sam. Eaton,</hi> call'd <hi>The Quakers Confuted.</hi> Printed. <hi>A. D.</hi> 1654. where p. 12. Mr. <hi>Eaton</hi> makes as full a Confeſſion as can be to the <hi>Inward Preſenſe</hi> and <hi>Operation</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> by His <hi>Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Hearts</hi> of <hi>Believers. And therein</hi> (ſays he) <hi>they have Him: But they have not</hi> Chriſt <hi>in</hi> Fleſh, <hi>or the</hi> Fleſh <hi>of</hi> Chriſt <hi>dwelling in them; for that was taken up into Heaven, and will there be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, till the Restitution of All things.</hi> This <hi>G. Fox</hi> oppoſes in his <hi>Great Myſtery</hi> p. 3. And Quotes thus much of his words, with the <hi>Page. But the Saints have not Chriſt in the Fleſh.</hi> p. 12. And oppoſes this, as <hi>Contrary to Chriſt and the Apoſtles Doctrin; who ſaid they were of His Fleſh and of his Bone</hi> — <hi>and they that have His Fleſh, have it in them.</hi> This ſhews in what ſenſe he Underſtood theſe <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> and what his Notion was of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> viz. That it was <hi>now</hi> at <hi>this time,</hi> in all <hi>Believers:</hi> and ſo not any <hi>Literal Fleſh,</hi> but ſome <hi>Imagination</hi> or other that they have of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Fleſh;</hi> which they think that <hi>God</hi> Himſelf has, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> or the <hi>Light</hi> had from all <hi>Eternity;</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:95758:71"/>ſo nothing of <hi>outward Human Fleſh</hi> or <hi>Nature.</hi> Tho' if you take the word <hi>Human</hi> as it may be Deriv'd from <hi>Homo</hi> a <hi>Man,</hi> thus they will allow that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has a True <hi>Human</hi> Body, and Ever had from <hi>Eternity,</hi> that is, a True and Real <hi>Manhood.</hi> In this ſenſe it is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore p. 11. l. 8. that they allow the <hi>Body</hi> which they ſay <hi>Chriſt</hi> had from <hi>Eternity</hi> to be an <hi>Human</hi> Body. For ther is no other word in <hi>Latin</hi> whereby to Expreſs the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> but <hi>Humanitas,</hi> whence we uſe the word <hi>Humanity</hi> to mean the ſame as <hi>Manhood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if you Derive the word <hi>Human</hi> from <hi>Humus</hi> the <hi>Ground</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> of which <hi>Man</hi> was Made, in this ſenſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> Deny that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had an <hi>Human</hi> Body from <hi>Eternity;</hi> or indeed while He was upon the <hi>Earth.</hi> For which I Refer you back to p. 19, 20. where you will find this <hi>Artfully</hi> Diſtinguiſh'd by the <hi>Quakers.</hi> But we will now go on to ſee the further <hi>Salvos</hi> that the Preſent <hi>Antidote</hi> affords in this Caſe.</p>

               <p>And to this, he ſays. p. 38. <hi>We are to ſeek herein, as not knowing where the</hi> Quakers <hi>ſay theſe things.</hi> Yet Anſwers not, or Names one of the many <hi>Proofs</hi> which are brought for this.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95758:71"/>Method. Yet in the <hi>Excuſe</hi> he makes for it, he <hi>Confeſſes</hi> enough, to ſhew that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are Guilty herein. For, ſays he, <hi>Tho' His</hi> Fleſh <hi>is call'd the</hi> Vail, <hi>yet it was that he own'd as His own Body, being alſo call'd the Body of</hi> Jeſus, <hi>which was not a Fantaſtical but a Real Body.</hi> Here is putting in things they are not Accuſed of, that they may ſeem to vindicate themſelves in ſomething. They are not Accuſed for ſaying that the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was a <hi>Fantaſtical,</hi> or not a <hi>Real Body;</hi> but that it was not <hi>Truly,</hi> that is, <hi>Hypoſtatically</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> only a <hi>Vail</hi> or <hi>Garment</hi> wherein He <hi>Dwelt:</hi> And, in that ſenſe, it was His <hi>Body,</hi> as a Man's <hi>Cloak</hi> or <hi>Garment</hi> is his <hi>Garment;</hi> and ſo <hi>it was that</hi> (as <hi>G.

And if the</hi> whole Perſon <hi>of Christ was not before the Earthly</hi> Adam, <hi>how was the Creation made by Him?

And hath a Human Body, and is not a Human Body, an Earthly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? was not the firſt man of the Earth, Earthly, and had an Human Body; the Second man, the Lord from Heaven?</hi> This is the <hi>Heavenly Body</hi> and <hi>Fleſh</hi> which they ſuppoſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> had from <hi>Eternity.</hi> But here, and in many other Places, they Deny <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have either <hi>Human Body</hi> or <hi>Soul,</hi> or to be a <hi>Man,</hi> otherwiſe than, as they ſay, He was <hi>Man</hi> before the Creation.

               <p>A <hi>He-Preacher</hi> at <hi>Charteres</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> being askt by G.

G. K.</hi> met with ſeveral the like Inſtances in that Journey: Which I will not here Repeat, becauſe we may have them, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in Reaſonable time from himſelf. And theſe which I have mention'd are ſufficient to ſhew, that however ſome at <hi>London</hi> wou'd Gloſs it, the <hi>Quaker Faith</hi> is not Grounded upon our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> but upon their <hi>Light within,</hi> which they will ſometimes ſo call, to Elude the world: And as they Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not that <hi>Chriſt</hi> took our <hi>Nature</hi> Truly and Really into His own <hi>Perſon,</hi> while He was upon the Earth; but only as a <hi>Cloak</hi> or <hi>Vaile</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And this being their <hi>Faith,</hi> they muſt needs think the Common <hi>Chriſt</hi> of all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as a True and Real <hi>Man,</hi> ſubſiſting in our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> now and for ever to come in <hi>Heaven,</hi> to be <hi>Falſe</hi> and a <hi>Lye;</hi> and conſequently to be an <hi>Idol,</hi> and our <hi>Worſhip</hi> of Him to be <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry:</hi> And as a neceſſary Conſequence of this, they muſt <hi>Hate</hi> and <hi>Deteſt</hi> our <hi>Chriſt;</hi> they muſt <hi>Curſe</hi> Him, and <hi>Renounce</hi> Him; as they have done, which I come next to ſhew.

               </p>
               <p>But the Quakers ſometimes Pretend, That by their Preaching againſt the <hi>outward Chriſt,</hi> they only mean to oppoſe thoſe, who Totally Exclude, the <hi>Sanctifying Graces</hi> of His H. <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> within <hi>

               </p>
               <p>Let me take this Place, to anſwer the <hi>Laſt Effort</hi> of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> upon this Head; and which being ſufficiently Cleared, leaves their <hi>Curſed</hi> Hereſie <hi>Naked</hi> and <hi>Expos'd</hi> to the <hi>Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> of All <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> are told of this their Artifice, in <hi>Sat. Diſ.</hi> Sect. 1. N. ix. p. 12. To. which <hi>G. W. Replies</hi> in this <hi>Antidote</hi> p. 210. 211. And Repeats the Charge againſt them thus. <hi>To my Adverſaries confidently Aſſerting</hi> (ſays he) <hi>That</hi> J.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95758:80"/>and Sufferings of</hi> Chriſt <hi>at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>i. e. without Freaching likewiſe the Inward operations of His Spirit in our Hearts. And that if</hi> Will. Penn, <hi>or</hi> Thom. Elwood <hi>cannot Name one ſingle Man, much leſs any of thoſe Communions which he Diſputes againſt, that ever thought Chriſt's out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Appearance wou'd ſave them, without His Inward Appearance, in their Conſciences, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom have they Diſputed?</hi> The <hi>Objection</hi> being thus ſtated (wherein I take no Notice of his miſplacing ſome words, to hurt both the <hi>Senſe</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi>) he <hi>Anſwers</hi> thus. <hi>Yes I can Name one</hi> Single Man, whom he has Vindicated againſt Us. (<hi>in G. K</hi>'s <hi>behalf</hi>) <hi>who has both thought and ſaid as much as, That Chriſt</hi>'s outward Appearance and Sufferings has ſaved them, without his Appearance or Work in them; And that is the ſaid Rob. Gordon; <hi>And it's Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt him, among his many other Corrupt Doctrins, by</hi> G. Keith. <hi>in My and his Book, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,</hi> The Nature of Chriſtianity. p. 70. 71. Artic. 1. That Chriſt without Us upon the Croſs, hath already ſubdued all things, finiſhed Tranſgreſſion, Made an end of Sin, aboliſh'd Condemnation and Death.</p>
               <p>Art. 8. That Redemption, Juſtification, were finiſhed and Completed in the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify'd Body of Chriſt for Us, not in our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Art. 12. That Redemption and all things are wrought, Purchas'd for Us, without the help of any thing to be wrought in Us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:95758:80"/>
                  <hi>So that here was one Man (i. e. R. G. and too many more) that laid the whole ſtreſs and work of Mans Salvation,</hi> Only <hi>upon Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>outward Appearance and Suffering, without His Inward Appearance and Operations by His Spirit in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have given <hi>G. W</hi>'s words at large, becauſe upon this Depends the whole Cauſe of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm.</hi> Therefore I will Examin them <hi>Fully</hi> and <hi>Fairly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But firſt, let me take notice of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty</hi> of the <hi>Quaker-ſtile. In My and His Book</hi> ſays <hi>G. W.</hi> It founds <hi>Harſh</hi> in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> becauſe, ſo <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nuſual.</hi> But <hi>G. W.</hi> wou'd not Give <hi>Place</hi> to <hi>G. K.</hi> He Reſerves His <hi>Dignity!</hi> And <hi>Comon Civility</hi> is an <hi>Hereſie</hi> among the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now to our Work. And firſt, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That <hi>G. W.</hi> has left out, in the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> he Quotes out of <hi>His</hi> and <hi>G. K</hi>'s Book, the <hi>pages</hi> in <hi>R. Gordon</hi>'s Book, call'd <hi>A Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the true Saviour,</hi> to which their <hi>Nature of Chriſtianity</hi> is in <hi>Anſwer.</hi> For there the <hi>Pages</hi> of <hi>R. G</hi>'s book are Quoted after Each <hi>Article.</hi> Which was wiſely done of <hi>G. W.</hi> That none might know where to find the <hi>Quotations,</hi> unleſs they wou'd have Recourſe to <hi>G. W</hi>'s <hi>Nature of Chriſtianity,</hi> which not one of a Thouſand knows where to find. It was Printed <hi>An.</hi> 1671. and now hardly to be Got. And <hi>G. W.</hi> not only leaves out the <hi>Pages,</hi> but do's not ſo much as Name that Book of <hi>R. G</hi>'s out of which they are taken, that his Reader might be left Sufficiently in the Dark. And that he had Good Reaſon ſo to do, will ſoon
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95758:81"/>Appear. To Theſe <hi>Articles</hi> here Quoted, theſe <hi>pages</hi> of <hi>R. G</hi>'s <hi>Teſtimony</hi> are added in <hi>The Nature of Chriſtianity.</hi> viz. p. 3. 4. 5. 20. And whoever will Read theſe, will ſee <hi>R. G.</hi> fully Clear himſelf from this Imputation caſt upon him; and that he had given no Ground at all for theſe Objections made againſt him.</p>
               <p>P. 4. and 5. he makes <hi>Two great Goſpel Truths.</hi> The firſt, <hi>God manifeſt in the Fleſh of Chriſt,</hi> whereby Chriſt <hi>became our H. Prieſt in the Fleſh, therein to offer up himſelf, the one Perfect</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>Sufficient</hi> Atonement, <hi>the Compleat</hi> Peace-Offering, Once <hi>for Ever, not</hi> often, <hi>and in Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Generation, and in</hi> Many <hi>Bodies</hi> (as the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> ſay he Dayly <hi>offers</hi> Himſelf in their Bodies) <hi>but in</hi> One <hi>Body, by</hi> one <hi>Offering, not in</hi> our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>or</hi> Within <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> (which is the Exact <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> Notion) <hi>but in His Crucifi'd Body without <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and before any Good wrought in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s; whereby He hath already ſubdued all things, finiſhed Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, made an end of Sin, Aboliſhed Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Death; and ſo hath for Ever, as our Head, in Himſelf compleated the work of our Redemption and Reconciliation with God for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s; God thereby commending His Love towards <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, that,</hi> while we were yet Sinners, <hi>Christ Dyed for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> when we were Enemies, <hi>we were Reconciled to God, by the Death of his Son,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The other Truth is the Myſtery of Chriſt, by His Spirit, Dwelling in His Saints, called in the H. Scripture,</hi> Chriſt within you; <hi>whereby God works</hi> In Us, <hi>through Faith in Chriſt, the Fruit
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95758:81"/>and Effect of the work already wrought by Chriſt, in His Crucifi'd Body, for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, without <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then he tells that for which he Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the <hi>Quakers, viz.</hi> That they <hi>Pretend ſo much zeal for this Myſterie of</hi> Chriſt within, <hi>the Operations and Actings of the Spirit of God</hi> in themſelves, <hi>That they Deny the Myſterie of God in the</hi> Fleſh <hi>of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>as a Matter of no Neceſſity to them, as to Redemption, Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Juſtification; Reckoning to Accompliſh this, in their own Bodies, Each for himſelf, thro' Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law or</hi> Light <hi>in his Conſcience: which</hi> Light <hi>they call</hi> Chriſt, Redeemer, <hi>and</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saviour; <hi>without Reſpect to the true Chriſt, and our only Saviour,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>of</hi> Nazareth <hi>and Redemption already wrought and Accompliſhed for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, in His Crucifi'd Body.</hi> Thus Plainly do's <hi>R. G.</hi> Expreſs himſelf, Giving full Teſtimony to <hi>Chriſt within,</hi> Dwelling in our <hi>Hearts</hi> by <hi>Faith:</hi> But Diſputes only againſt that <hi>Quaker Hereſie,</hi> of Placing the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Atonement</hi> for <hi>Sin,</hi> in the <hi>offering</hi> up of this <hi>Light within,</hi> Perform'd in their <hi>Hearts;</hi> and throwing off the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Atonement</hi> made by the <hi>offering</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> made of <hi>Himſelf</hi> for Us, upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> as of no Efficacy to our <hi>Salvation.</hi> This is it, for which the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſe him, and which <hi>G. W.</hi> here calls <hi>Corrupt Dectrin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And obſerve, That in the 12 <hi>Art.</hi> above Quoted, <hi>R. G</hi>'s words are Recited Imperfect; for after the laſt words here put down. viz. <hi>without the help of any thing to be wrought in us,</hi> ther follows in <hi>R. G</hi>'s words p. 20. <hi>ſo as to Atone with God for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> which Explains his
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95758:82"/>Meaning, and is moſt <hi>Orthodox viz.</hi> That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Perform'd <hi>In us,</hi> is the <hi>Atonement</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> for our <hi>Sins.</hi> But this, in no ways, Hinders, or <hi>Denies</hi> the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of the <hi>Inward Preſence,</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of his <hi>H. Spirit,</hi> to <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> our <hi>Hearts;</hi> whereby only that <hi>Atonement</hi> Perform'd by <hi>Christ,</hi> in <hi>His</hi> own <hi>Body,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> is <hi>Apply'd,</hi> and Made <hi>Effectual</hi> to Us. Which <hi>R. G.</hi> over and over again, not only <hi>Aſſerts,</hi> but Zealouſly <hi>Contends</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>Now let the Reader Judge, whether <hi>G. W.</hi> has found an Inſtance in <hi>R. G.</hi> of one who Aſſerted, <hi>That Chriſt's outward Appearance and Sufferings, wou'd ſave any, without His Appearance and Work in them?</hi> The doing Right to <hi>R. G.</hi> is not the Matter. I ſhou'd not have Detain'd the Reader ſo long, meerly for that. But, by this it is very Evident, That the <hi>Quakers</hi> have all along oppos'd the <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrin, and Rejected all <hi>Faith,</hi> in <hi>our Lord Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> as to our <hi>Redemption</hi> or <hi>Salvation,</hi> by His <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our <hi>Sins</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs.</hi> Why elſe did they <hi>Oppoſe</hi> (and that ſo <hi>Vehemently</hi>) thoſe who Preached this <hi>Doctrin:</hi> and who alſo own'd the <hi>Inward Preſence</hi> and <hi>operations</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> by His B. <hi>Spirit</hi> in our <hi>Hearts;</hi> not only as <hi>Beneficial,</hi> but <hi>Abſolutely Neceſſary</hi> towards our <hi>Salvation;</hi> and without which, That the outward <hi>Sufferings</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all His <hi>Ordinances, wou'd be to us, as if they were not at all, or Worſe,</hi> as before Quoted? Why did <hi>G. Fox, G. Whitehead,</hi> and all the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> oppoſe this? They have Nothing left to ſay, But that thoſe whom they <hi>Oppos'd</hi> did <hi>Deny</hi> the <hi>Inward opperations</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95758:82"/>
                  <hi>Heart</hi> and that in this only they did oppoſe them, Which being moſt Falſe; and they not being able to Produce <hi>one Single Perſon,</hi> who did <hi>Oppoſe</hi> them <hi>In this;</hi> ſhews what that was wherein they did <hi>Oppoſe</hi> them. Or if they cou'd find ſuch a Single Perſon, why did they oppoſe <hi>Others,</hi> who had ſufficiently Explain'd themſelves <hi>In this,</hi> ſuch as theſe before Nam'd? Why did they call Theſe <hi>Devils, Anti-Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Sorcerers,</hi> for Preaching of <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth?</hi> Why did they <hi>Belch</hi> out, in <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> ſuch <hi>Spitefull</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemous Contempt,</hi> as before Quoted, againſt the <hi>Perſon</hi> of our B. <hi>Lord Jeſus?</hi> Why did they call Him <hi>Accurſed!</hi> Let them hear the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> That <hi>no Man Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by the Spirit of God, calleth</hi> Jeſus <hi>Accurſed:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. xii.3.</note>
                  <hi>And that no Man can ſay that</hi> Jeſus <hi>is the</hi> Lord, <hi>but by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Therefore till they come, not only to <hi>ſay,</hi> but to <hi>Believe</hi> this, they may be ſure, That it is not the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> but of <hi>Anti-Christ</hi> by which they are Acted. And they cannot Truly <hi>Believe</hi> this, without not only being <hi>willing,</hi> but in an High Degree <hi>Zealous,</hi> to <hi>Confeſs, Retract,</hi> and <hi>Condemn,</hi> the Above Quoted, and all other their vile <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,</hi> and <hi>Outrages</hi> againſt our B. <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>only</hi> Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>I cou'd bring Multitudes of Quotations to the ſame Purpoſe of theſe before Produc'd, be ſides what are offer'd in the <hi>Sn,</hi> to which <hi>G.

                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:95758:86"/>and the Reaſon given ſhews it, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Quakers</hi> think themſelves to be <hi>Perfect,</hi> and without <hi>Sin;</hi> and therefore do not make any <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of their <hi>Sins,</hi> or Begg <hi>Pardon</hi> for them. Now what has this to do with any other ſort of <hi>Prayers?</hi> of which <hi>G.

If ther needed further <hi>Vouchers,</hi> I cou'd Produce Many, even as Many of their Hearers as will ſpeak the Truth. But I will give one Remarkable one which will ſhew that it is not <hi>Forgetfulneſs</hi> in them, but againſt their <hi>Principle.</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Criſpe</hi> was of their Communion about 30 years, a Conſtant <hi>Hearer,</hi> and a Zealous <hi>Sufferer</hi> too among them. But he took offence at their never having any <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> or <hi>Prayer</hi> for the <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of it, in their <hi>Publick Meetings;</hi> and complain'd of it above 20 years ago. But no <hi>Rectification</hi> — No not at this Day, when they are putting a new Face upon all their Matters; But they will not be brought to this, to Confeſs themſelves <hi>Sinners;</hi> for then they might be brought to <hi>Repentance;</hi> of which they Declare themſelves <hi>Incapable.</hi> For this, among other <hi>vile Hereſies,</hi> Mr. <hi>Criſpe</hi> has <hi>ſeperated</hi> from them; of which he has given us a very Good
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95758:87"/>Account, in Several Treaties he has wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Quakers.</hi> They who were of them, muſt know them beſt.

Secondly, You do not Pray to Chriſt, becauſe it being Chriſt in you that Prays, it is Abſur'd for Chriſt to Pray to Himſelf.</hi> Thus you ſee their Practice is Uniform, all the world over: yet not Conſiſtent with it ſelf.

               <p>Ther is another Inſtance of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Reſpect to the <hi>Bible,</hi> which <hi>G. W.</hi> mentions p. 43. of a <hi>Quaker Servant-Maid</hi> who Burn'd the <hi>Bible</hi> Publickly againſt the <hi>Church</hi> (for greater Contempt!) in <hi>Bread-ſtreet.</hi> This is

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is well, <hi>George,</hi> that thou do'ſt admit the Commands to <hi>Preach</hi> and <hi>Baptize</hi> to be <hi>Special</hi> Commands given only to <hi>Some:</hi> How then came <hi>Thee</hi> and thy <hi>Quakers</hi> by that <hi>Authority?</hi> Think of this, <hi>George,</hi> for it Concerns thee.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How do's <hi>Ed. Burrough</hi> immediately <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain himſelf</hi> (as thee ſay'ſt) that he means this of <hi>Special</hi> Commands? It is true he do's name ſome <hi>Special</hi> Commands, as to <hi>Baptize</hi> and <hi>Preach:</hi> and ſome he ſays were ſent to do both, <hi>To Baptiſm</hi> (as he Abſurdly words it) <hi>and to Preach the Goſpel:</hi> and <hi>Another was ſent</hi> (ſays he) <hi>not to Baptize but to Preach the Goſpel.</hi> He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17.

               <p>But were theſe <hi>Special</hi> Commands all the Conteſt betwixt <hi>Ed. Burrough</hi> and <hi>J. Turner,</hi> in anſwer to whom he ſaid theſe words? No. not only not <hi>All</hi> the Conteſt: But they were no <hi>Part</hi> nor <hi>Particle</hi> of the Conteſt; and were very Impertinently brought in by <hi>E.

B.</hi> himſelf, was Charging this as a <hi>Quaker Principle,</hi> viz. <hi>That Saints were not to do</hi> Duties <hi>by or from a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand without, but from a Command within; and that the word Command in Scripture, was not a Command to them, till they had a word within them.</hi> And this E. B. <hi>Juſtifies,</hi> inſtead of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:95758:95"/>it, and ſays, <hi>That is no Command from God to me, what He Commands to Another, and then</hi> J. Turner, <hi>or any other, who go's to</hi> Duty, <hi>as you call it, by Imitation from the Letter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>—This was wrote in the Year 1654. And we all know what they meant by that Phraſe of <hi>Going to Duty,</hi> to Perform <hi>Family-Duty,</hi> &amp;c. It was the <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant by theſe Expreſſions. And here <hi>E. B.</hi> means the ſame, for he ſpeaks of Going to Duty, <hi>as you call it,</hi> ſays he; that is, in their ſenſe, and what they meant by it. And in the ſame p. 47. upon the next Queſtion, <hi>As to the time of going to Duties,</hi> he ſays, Expreſly, <hi>All Duties, as ſhe calls them, whatſoever.</hi> She <hi>Jane</hi> or <hi>Joan Turner</hi> againſt whom he Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, did not Pretend to the Power of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> to <hi>Baptize,</hi> or any <hi>Special</hi> Command; but puts the Caſe, and the whole Diſpute was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Obligation</hi> that lay upon us to Perform all our <hi>Duties</hi> to <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man;</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Commands in <hi>Scripture</hi> did lay any <hi>Obligation</hi> upon us to obſerve them? And this the <hi>Quakers</hi> Poſitively Deny; or that ther Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes any <hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>Duty,</hi> or that any <hi>Command</hi> is a <hi>Duty,</hi> except what is Enjoyn'd by their own <hi>Light Within:</hi> as <hi>W.

Planted in our <hi>Minds</hi> by <hi>God:</hi> and that it is a <hi>Ray,</hi> or <hi>Communication</hi> of the <hi>Divine Light.</hi> Wherein then do they Differ from the <hi>Quakers?</hi> only in this, That they call this <hi>Light within</hi> by the Name of <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Which word the <hi>Quakers</hi> do not like, becauſe they Reſolv'd to go out of the Rode of all Common ſpeaking. But they Mean the Same thing. For they Deny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other <hi>Light</hi> in the <hi>Soul,</hi> but that which is
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95758:97"/>
                  <hi>Divine.</hi> And this <hi>Light within,</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Deiſts</hi> make the <hi>Supreame Rule,</hi> not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable by <hi>Scripture,</hi> or any thing elſe; but <hi>Sufficient</hi> of it ſelf, <hi>Without any thing elſe.</hi> i. e. without <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>outward Jeſus.</hi> For that God Requires no more of any man, but to Follow this <hi>Light within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And This is all the <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> which the <hi>Quakers</hi> do own. This they ſay is To have <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Hence, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude All <hi>Moral Deiſts,</hi> whether <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> to be <hi>Chriſtians. G. Fox,</hi> in his <hi>Gr. Myſt.</hi> p. 56. Sets down an <hi>Objection</hi> againſt the <hi>Quakers, viz.</hi> That they ſay, that any can have <hi>The Sight of the Godhead, without Faith in Chriſt.</hi> And he do's not Deny this to be their <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> but Juſtifies it. He Anſwers, <hi>Can any ſee the Godhead? have a ſight of the Godhead? and not ſee Chriſt, and have Faith in Chriſt?</hi> By this, the <hi>Jews</hi> have <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for they Acknowledge the <hi>Godhead.</hi> And the <hi>Gentiles</hi> too. <hi>Becauſe that which may be known of God is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them:</hi>

                  <hi>For the Inviſible things of Him, from the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world are Clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even His Eternal Power and Godhead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſame manner the ſucceeding <hi>Quakers</hi> do <hi>Chime</hi> in after <hi>G. Fox. T. Elwood,</hi> in his late <hi>Anſwer to</hi> G.

For thus he Deſcribes Chriſt. <hi>What is Chriſt, but Meekneſs, Juſtice,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:95758:98"/>Mercy</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Can we then Deny a Meek man to be a Chriſtian?</hi> And putting the objection againſt a <hi>Moral Heathen</hi> thus. <hi>Why! tho' this Perſon be a</hi> Sober Liver, <hi>yet he is but a</hi> General <hi>Believer; his</hi> Faith <hi>is at</hi> Large: <hi>'Tis true, He believes in</hi> God; <hi>but I hear little of his</hi> Faith <hi>in</hi> Chriſt. Then, as <hi>T. E.</hi> ſays, <hi>W. P.</hi> Replies very well, <hi>Do's he not</hi> therefore <hi>believe in Chriſt?</hi> For, <hi>As he that believes in Chriſt, believes in God, ſo he that believes in God, believes in Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Quakery</hi> is a <hi>Scandal</hi> even to <hi>Deiſm.</hi> And as the <hi>Quakers</hi> out-ſhoot the other <hi>Deiſts</hi> vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Non-ſenſe,</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy:</hi> ſo they come not nearer to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> in any thing that might Ballance. No, not as to the Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment which they make to the H. <hi>Scriptures.</hi> For the <hi>Deiſts</hi> too, as the <hi>Quakers,</hi> will ſpeak <hi>(ſometimes)</hi> Honourably of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſay they are Good Books, and many Good things in them. And Delight to Read them. But then, not to Truſt to Every thing that is in them. Only ſo far as is Agreeable to their own <hi>Light within.</hi> And in this, they Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:95758:98"/>to ſupport themſelves, by the <hi>Various Readings, Copies,</hi> and <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> of the H. <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to Render them <hi>

               </p>
               <p>And from them the <hi>Quakers</hi> have taken up the ſame Argument againſt the Authority of the H. <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Tho' they have the leaſt skill in that <hi>Critical</hi> part of <hi>Learning,</hi> of any ſort of Men upon the face of the Earth.

               </p>
               <p>But All <hi>Tranſlations</hi> do agree in what is <hi>Material,</hi> either as to <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Manners:</hi> And therefore theſe, and the various <hi>Readings</hi> of <hi>Copies</hi> Different both as to the <hi>Countries</hi> and <hi>Ages</hi> in which they were Tranſcrib'd, and <hi>Tranſlated,</hi> inſtead of Militating againſt the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> of the H. <hi>Scriptures,</hi> are a Mighty Confirmation of Both; becauſe this is a Demonſtration that ſuch <hi>Copies</hi> cou'd not have been wrote by <hi>Conſert:</hi> And the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between them is no more than what was Natural and Eaſie, and almoſt Unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to fall out, in the Common Miſtakes of ſo many Several <hi>Amanuenſes,</hi> and <hi>Tranſlations.</hi> But all agreeing in the Full of the <hi>Faith</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Deliver'd, and Differing in nothing that can make any Alteration in that, Gives us the Greater, and an Undoubted <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of Truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſo Agreeing in all their various <hi>Tranſlations</hi> and <hi>Editions,</hi> as a <hi>Sure</hi> and <hi>Certain Rule</hi> both as to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Manners.</hi>

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95758:102"/>ours is now, or as His own <hi>Fleſh</hi> was while He <hi>Suffer'd</hi> in it upon the Earth? No. For we ſay, all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſay, that <hi>He</hi> is now <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd.</hi> Ther is then no other ſenſe' of the word <hi>Carnal,</hi> but that which has <hi>Fleſh,</hi> in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction from a <hi>Spirit.</hi> And in this ſenſe, we do ſay, and all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>Carnal.</hi> i. e. has Real <hi>Fleſh,</hi> even the ſame <hi>Fleſh</hi> which He took of the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin,</hi> in which He <hi>Suffer'd, Roſe,</hi> &amp;c. And this is the ſenſe in which the <hi>Quakers</hi> do Oppoſe us, and <hi>Deny,</hi> nay <hi>Ridicule</hi> our <hi>Carnal</hi> Chriſt <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Stars.</hi> i. e.

Your Carnal Chriſt</hi> (ſays <hi>C.

                  <p>AS <hi>Giants</hi> were attended by <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> and <hi>Knights</hi> had their <hi>Squires</hi> ready at hand, to ſave them ſometimes at a Dead lift, ſo have our <hi>Quaker <hi>Heroes</hi>
                     </hi> made a <hi>Cats-foot</hi> of poor <hi>Joſeph Wyeth,</hi> to Blount their Enemies Swords; That if he ſhou'd Prevail, their Glory might appear the Greater, in Giving the Foil by a hand ſo Inconſiderable as the <hi>Journey-Man</hi> of <hi>Ben.

                     </hi> But if he was overthrown (which they knew full eaſie, unleſs from the weakneſs of his opponent) then their <hi>ſhift</hi> was,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95758:104"/>that all the <hi>Diſgrace</hi> ſhou'd fall upon him, who had no <hi>Honour</hi> to Loſe, and They and their Cauſe be Guiltleſs, tho' All their ſtrength was Exerted in what they put out under his Name.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Reader</hi> muſt know that it is a ſtated <hi>Diſciplin</hi> of the <hi>Quakers</hi> (notwithſtanding of their <hi>Infallibility</hi>) to let none of their <hi>Friends</hi> Books (as they call them) be put to the <hi>Preſs,</hi> untill they have Undergone the <hi>Cenſure,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the <hi>Approbation</hi> of their <hi>Second-Days-Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> which conſiſts only of their <hi>Miniſters</hi> or <hi>Preachers.</hi> Nor Dare any of their <hi>Printers</hi> Print any of their Books, without the Allowance of this <hi>Sanhedrin:</hi> ſo that they ſtand All Chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for All of their <hi>Printed</hi> Books; at leaſt for All of them, which they have not call'd in, and witneſſed againſt, as they did againſt <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rogers</hi> his <hi>Chriſtian Quaker</hi> (becauſe it had more of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in it than they cou'd Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt) and Puniſh'd both <hi>Printer</hi> and <hi>Publiſhers,</hi> with the utmoſt ſeverity that was in their Power. as you may ſee in <hi>Sat.

                  <p>But inſtead of ſhewing any ſuch Diſpleaſure againſt this Book that bears <hi>Wyeth</hi>'s Name, the <hi>Chief</hi> of the <hi>Quakers</hi> do Recommend it, and Hand it about among Perſons of all Qualities; which is owning of it, as much as if their Names had been ſet to it: Beſides ſome <hi>Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes</hi> in the <hi>Stile,</hi> which ſhew that ſome had a <hi>Finger</hi> in the <hi>Pye,</hi> tho' they wou'd not have their <hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In all of which, no Employment ſo ſervile was put upon him, as to ſet his Name to a Book, that gives him the Lye ſo Egregiouſly in that Character which he himſelf, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-brib'd</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-ſolicited,</hi> has beſtow'd upon the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of <hi>The Snake in the Graſs,</hi> of being <hi>A man of Temper</hi> &amp;c. Whereas this Book do's Repreſent him ſo far otherwiſe (as you will ſee hereafter <hi>Sect.</hi> ii.) that it is not poſſible to Reconcile ſuch Contradictions, if they came Both from the ſame Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, in the <hi>Title-Page</hi> of this Book, it is ſaid to <hi>Serve as an</hi> Appendix <hi>to</hi> George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head<hi>'s Antidote againſt the Snake in the Graſs.</hi> And ſure <hi>George Whitehead</hi> wou'd not ſuffer an <hi>Appendix</hi> to be fix'd to his ſo Famous a Book, without his own Approbation; nor can it be Imagin'd that <hi>Joſeph</hi> wou'd have offer'd at it. Therefore we muſt ſuppoſe that <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> is more Particularly Concern'd in this <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix;</hi> And we muſt (for all the Reaſons aforeſaid) conclude, That this is the Joint and Concerted <hi>Apologie</hi> of the <hi>Quakers;</hi> otherwiſe it wou'd not be worth my while, nor the Pains of the <hi>Reader,</hi> to Labour a Point, which cou'd End in no more than a Confutation of <hi>Joſeph Wyeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this, in Probability, was one Main Drift of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to Stop a <hi>Reply;</hi> that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95758:105"/>they might have the <hi>Laſt Word;</hi> which, with many, Paſſes for a Token of <hi>Victory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Charity that I have for their Souls, of thoſe Many miſerably Deluded by theſe their <hi>Leaders</hi> (tho' they put all the Miſconſtruction upon it that <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> can Invent) has Oblig'd me to Enter once more with them into the Liſts: And I hope to make the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of their Groſs <hi>Deluſions</hi> ſo Plain by this, as to Stop any further need of my Labour herein; And to Satisfie all who are Deſirous or Capable of Conviction.</p>
                  <p>The Method I will take, in <hi>Replying</hi> to this <hi>Appendix,</hi> is, to Take a View of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Manner of <hi>Anſwering</hi> Books that are wrote againſt them. And <hi>Applying</hi> it to this Preſent <hi>Anſwer,</hi> will ſhew, That however in other things the <hi>Quakers</hi> are <hi>Chang'd,</hi> yet they ſtill keep true to their <hi>Original</hi> and Ever Conſtant <hi>Furie, Falshood,</hi> and <hi>Dodging,</hi> either in <hi>Defending</hi> of <hi>Themſelves,</hi> or <hi>Repreſenting</hi> of their <hi>Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>

Such <hi>words</hi> as they have found out of <hi>Spite</hi> and Inveterat <hi>Rancor,</hi> never came into the Heads of any either at <hi>Bedlam</hi> or <hi>Billings-Gate,</hi> or were never ſo put together, by any that I ever heard, and I have had the Curioſity to ſee <hi>Mother Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> whoſe <hi>Rethorick</hi> was <hi>Honey</hi> to the <hi>Paſſion</hi> with which the <hi>Quaker</hi> Books are ſtuff'd.</p>
                  <p>And which is more ſtrange, it is not in their Power to Help it, or they will not.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95758:106"/>as to any other Part of his Book. But the ſeveral <hi>Charges</hi> which he lays againſt their <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> he Proves from their own Printed Books, and Quotes their <hi>Pages,</hi> ſo that let him be what ſort of man he will, this makes nothing as to the <hi>Charge</hi> againſt the <hi>Quakers:</hi> All that is to be done in that Caſe, is, to Diſprove his <hi>Quotations,</hi> either that he has Quoted <hi>Falſe,</hi> or <hi>Impertinently,</hi> and not to the Purpoſe for which he has Produc'd them.

But, on the other hand, he was acquainted, at that time, with ſome of the <hi>Rich</hi> Quaker <hi>Church,</hi> and his Byaſs,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95758:107"/>as to Perſonal Kindneſs, lay wholly on their ſide; and they only were capable, and very Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they were and are, to <hi>Hire</hi> or Give <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi> In ſhort, I am very well Aſſur'd that the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Sn.</hi> had not one ſingle far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Contribution from any Perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever towards <hi>Printing</hi> of that Book or the <hi>Writing</hi> of it. And the Controverſie with the <hi>Quakers</hi> was ſuch a Dead thing, that the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller wou'd hardly have ventur'd upon the firſt <hi>Edition,</hi> if he had known that it wou'd have ſwell'd, while in the Preſs, ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the firſt intended Bounds.

For what if this <hi>Clergy-Man</hi> (whoever it be whom they mean) had been <hi>Depriv'd,</hi> or <hi>Expuls'd</hi> (as they word it) becauſe he had a Tenderneſs as to <hi>Swearing,</hi> the Objection comes <hi>Decently</hi> out of the mouth of a <hi>Quaker!</hi> Nay further, Suppoſe he had not only <hi>Sculk'd,</hi> but been in a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation;</hi> And underhand kept fair with the Government, at the ſame time, to ſave his Bacon on both Sides?

                  <p>And as for the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Sn.</hi> Receiving his <hi>Bread</hi> from them, that has been ſpoke to already: But it is Cautiouſly added here <hi>[In Part]</hi> that he <hi>Receives his Bread, in Part, from them;</hi> ſo that if he ever <hi>Eat</hi> or <hi>Drunk</hi> with any of them, this is Receiving his Bread, <hi>in Part,</hi> from them.

                  <p>If they Pretend that they are Provok'd to this Manner of Repartying upon their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, by their ill uſage of them, particularly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95758:109"/>the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Sn.</hi> in <hi>Reviling</hi> and <hi>Abuſing</hi> of them. <hi>Firſt,</hi> If this were true, it ought not to <hi>Provoke</hi> them, who ſet up for Degrees of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Self-Denyal,</hi> and <hi>Mortification</hi> beyond All other ſort of men upon the face of the Earth; to be <hi>Meeker</hi> than <hi>Moſes,</hi> Wiſer than <hi>Solomon,</hi> more <hi>Patient</hi> than <hi>Job,</hi> &amp;c. (See <hi>Sat. Dis.</hi> Sect. iv. N. v. p. 48.) And if they ſhew not this more than other men, how ſhall we know that they have it more than other men? But <hi>Secondly,</hi> at their firſt Appearing in the world, before any <hi>Provocation</hi> was Given to them, they fell upon All others with the ſame <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>outrage,</hi> that they have ſince continu'd. They were the <hi>Aggreſſors</hi> and Gave the <hi>Provocation,</hi> inſtead of Receiving any. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> as to their Complaint of <hi>Provocation</hi> in the <hi>Sn.</hi> ther is none given them, but that of <hi>Detecting</hi> their <hi>Errors;</hi> And that in ſo <hi>ſoft</hi> a manner to the Chief of them, that (as before Mention'd) in this <hi>Appendix,</hi> it is term'd <hi>Fawning.</hi> It is hard to Pleaſe theſe men. If you be <hi>Civil</hi> to them, they conſtrue it <hi>Fawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and if you be <hi>Plain</hi> with them, they call it <hi>Vilifying</hi> and <hi>Reproaching</hi> of them. Indeed in the <hi>Sn.</hi> their <hi>Errors</hi> are Laid open very <hi>Plainly;</hi> and <hi>Hard-words</hi> are given to them. But <hi>How?</hi> When their <hi>Errors</hi> are ſuch as have no <hi>Soft Names,</hi> we muſt Give them the <hi>Names</hi> by which all the World know them. How elſe ſhou'd we be Underſtood? If I Accuſe a man of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie</hi> or <hi>Idolatry,</hi> muſt I not call it <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Idolatry?</hi> Or muſt I Invent <hi>New</hi> Names for <hi>Old Crimes?</hi> Indeed if I Fail in my <hi>Proof,</hi> I have done Injury to the <hi>Accuſed;</hi> and ought to make <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> when I am Fairly <hi>Convinc'd:</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95758:110"/>Yet if my <hi>Miſtake</hi> was thro' <hi>Ignorance,</hi> it do's not come within the Denomination of <hi>Rayling,</hi> if the Diſpute be Manag'd without <hi>Perſonal Reflections,</hi> which do not concern the Debate. A man may Reaſon with Great <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Good Manners,</hi> againſt <hi>Heathen, Turk, Jew,</hi> or <hi>Papiſt;</hi> and tho' the <hi>Charges</hi> be High of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi> or <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yet this will not be Counted <hi>Rayling,</hi> if it meet with men of <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Good Temper.</hi> Nay, ther is no other way of being Convinc'd, on either ſide, but by <hi>Fairly</hi> and <hi>Calmly,</hi> yet <hi>Plainly</hi> and <hi>Thoroly</hi> Diſcuſſing of the Arguments on Both ſides. Now if the <hi>Quakers</hi> can find any other <hi>Ill-Names</hi> Given to them in the <hi>Sn.</hi> than what was Neceſſary to the Charges laid againſt them, they have Read it more Carefully than I have done. Are they there call'd <hi>Raging Doggs, Green-Headed-Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Devils Incarnat, Devil-Driven-Dungy-Gods, Sodomits,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Vile Names</hi> as they have Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Beſtow'd upon the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Sn.</hi> and others who have <hi>Oppoſed</hi> Them? And can they not now Forbear it at laſt, after being ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten told of it? This gives men a ſtrange <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Fierceneſs</hi> of the <hi>Quaker-Spirit,</hi> beyond what all their <hi>Adverſaries</hi> cou'd ſay againſt them. Therefore I hope they will, in their After <hi>Anſwers,</hi> Practiſe that <hi>Self-Denial</hi> (if it be in their Power) to Abridge themſelves of this their ſo Beloved a <hi>Topick</hi> of <hi>Rayling;</hi> at leaſt, in that <hi>Blunt, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmannerly</hi> way, which Renders their Diſcourſes, tho' they were otherwiſe valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, moſt <hi>Nauſeous</hi> to all men of <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:</hi> For which Reaſon I have Inſiſted ſo long upon it in this, to <hi>Cure</hi> them, if Poſſible, of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95758:110"/>what is ſo juſt a <hi>Prejudice</hi> againſt them; that we may get them to be a little <hi>Sociable</hi> and <hi>Tame;</hi> to Converſe, like other men, tho' we Differ from them, without <hi>Flying</hi> in our <hi>Faces.</hi> But if they ſtill continue to <hi>Bite,</hi> they muſt be <hi>Muzl'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they ſay that they never <hi>Snarle,</hi> but where they are <hi>Provok'd.</hi> It is Impoſſible to Begin with them, without <hi>Provoking</hi> of them; for if you oppoſe any of their <hi>Errors,</hi> then they <hi>Rave</hi> and <hi>Rage</hi> like <hi>Furies!</hi> Ther is no <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> like it! And the Truth of it is, the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Sn.</hi> did <hi>Begin</hi> with Them. And has got his Reward, for thruſting his Hand into this <hi>Neſt</hi> of <hi>Hornets.</hi> But will they be more <hi>Moderate,</hi> where they <hi>Begin</hi> with others, <hi>Invite</hi> and <hi>Provoke</hi> them to the Diſpute? No. It is all one. They are as Fierce upon the <hi>Attack,</hi> as in their <hi>Defence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ther was one <hi>John Wigan</hi> an <hi>Annabaptiſt Preacher,</hi> who was Priſoner with <hi>George Fox</hi> and others of them in the <hi>Caſtle</hi> at <hi>Lancaster,</hi> in the Year 1664. And without his ever open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Mouth to one of them, only Paſſing thro' a Common Room where they were, they <hi>Attack'd</hi> him, and the firſt words were, <hi>Leave off thy Deceiving the People, Thou art a Deceiver.</hi> To which he return'd no more <hi>Provoking</hi> an <hi>Anſwer,</hi> than to Ask, <hi>wherein he was a Deceiver?</hi> and how they <hi>cou'd Prove him to be ſuch?</hi> Then they Challeng'd him to a <hi>Diſpute.</hi> To which he not being over Forward.

This was all the <hi>Provocation</hi> he Gave them; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Proving</hi> it ſo Effectually that they were not Able to <hi>Anſwer</hi> him.

However it do's not Deny the <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Wigan</hi>'s <hi>Relation</hi> of this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;</hi> and therefore we may Depend upon this Book of <hi>Wigan</hi>'s for ſo far True as it Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they are not thereby <hi>Mis-Repreſented.</hi> But what they found fault with, <hi>Curwin</hi> tells him in another Paper which he ſent him. <hi>Thy ill-bred Behaviour</hi> (ſays he to <hi>Wigan</hi>) <hi>thy ill-bred ſaucy Tongue, un-nurtured and un-bred: And beſides thy ſaucy Language.

Thomas Davenport</hi> put in his Thruſt, and ſaid <hi>Thou haſt Deny'd Chriſt to Day.

He was out of Breath. But he was <hi>Seconded</hi> to Purpoſe by a young Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Champion, <hi>John Berley,</hi> who Hewed him thus. <hi>The Eternal Judgments of God will fall upon thee, and Burn the up as Chaff: Thou art worſe than a Drunkard.</hi> At which the <hi>Knight</hi> Fled—but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95758:112"/>did not Eſcape ſo. For <hi>James Park</hi> Purſu'd him to his <hi>Chamber,</hi> and there gave him the <hi>Parting Blow,</hi> with <hi>great Vehemency</hi> (ſays <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> p. 21.) in theſe words. <hi>Thou art a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, and a Deceiver, and the Curſe of God will be upon thee in thy Bed-Chamber, and Cloſet, and wherever thou goeſt,</hi> &amp;c. Nor cou'd this ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.

                  </p>
                  <p>Ther is a Book wrote by <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>three</hi> other <hi>Quakers</hi> viz. <hi>Chriſtopher Atkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, James Lancaſter,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Symons</hi> (of whoſe Character ſee <hi>Sn.</hi> Sect. vi. n. v. p. 43. &amp;c.)

He</hi> (<hi>Mr.</hi> Townsend) <hi>is ſhut up with the three Perſons in perpetual Darkneſs for the Lake and the Pit.</hi> This is thus Quoted, by <hi>Chriſtoph.

Myſt.</hi> which bears this Title, <hi>To all thoſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Quakers</hi> &amp;c. To which <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> Replies, in his <hi>Truth defending the Quakers.</hi> An. 1659. And denies not the above <hi>Quotations</hi> out of his own Book <hi>Iſhmael</hi> &amp;c. But (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> uſe, when Pinch'd) he ſlips it over, and takes no notice of it. Not that he was Converted from his <hi>Hereſie,</hi> for in ſeveral other Places of the ſame Book, he continues to <hi>Blaſpheme,</hi> at his old Rate, againſt the H. <hi>Trinity.</hi> as in p. 40. 41. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But finding that the Matter was not thus Forgot, being Re-Objected againſt them about the year 1690, in <hi>An Epiſtle to the Friends &amp;c. at their next General Meeting in London.</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd <hi>N. N.</hi> Ther was Publiſh'd an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this and two other Books wrote againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> by <hi>Some of Them.</hi> Intituled, <hi>The Chriſtianity of the People commonly call'd</hi> Quakers <hi>Vindicated</hi> &amp;c. Printed <hi>An.</hi> 1690. There p. 28. coming to this Objection, they go a New way to work, and lay the Fault <hi>Partly</hi> upon the <hi>Printer,</hi> And <hi>Looks on the words as wrong writ, or wrong Printed.</hi> Wrong <hi>Writ,</hi> and wrong <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> are two things. But they Jumble them here, that the Reader might miſtake, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the <hi>Author,</hi> and ſo think it only an <hi>Error</hi> of the <hi>Preſs.</hi> But what was this <hi>Error?</hi> Why they ſay, That <hi>inſtead of <hi>[And the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons]</hi> it ſhou'd have rather been <hi>[About the three Perſons]</hi>
                     </hi> which makes it <hi>non-ſenſe,</hi> but not leſs
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95758:123"/>
                     <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi> But however, was this taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in all that time from the writing of that <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>Townsend</hi> (which the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay in this laſt book <hi>ibid.</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 1654.) till this Book of theirs An. 1690, that is, for the ſpace of 44 years? No. That is not Alledg'd. But they ſay <hi>(ibid.)</hi> that G. W. <hi>Corrected it long ſince, where he has met with that Anſwer.</hi> How do's this Appear? O you muſt take his own word for it: for is not He <hi>Infallible!</hi> But was not ſo <hi>Fatal</hi> a <hi>Slip</hi> of <hi>Infallibility</hi> fit to be Corrected in <hi>Print,</hi> to Remove that moſt <hi>Hideous</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemous Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal?</hi> which cou'd not be done otherwiſe. For to what end was <hi>G. W</hi>'s. Correcting it with a Pen upon a Book that came in his way? (if he did it) How ſhou'd this Un-deceive the World? Who had never heard of it, if he had not now told them. And it is at their Pleaſure how far they will Believe him. This is like another <hi>Error</hi> of the <hi>Preſs,</hi> which they let ſlip 28 years together. (See <hi>Sat. Dis.</hi> Sect. ii. N. iii. p. 28.) And their Appealing from their <hi>Printed Books</hi> to the <hi>Original Copies.</hi> See hereafter N. 7. of this ſame <hi>Section.</hi> And how came it that none but <hi>G. W.</hi> Corrected this <hi>Monſtrous Blaſphemy?</hi> Were not the Reſt of the <hi>Quakers</hi> likewiſe Concern'd?</p>
                  <p>Well, if this will not do, they have another Excuſe. They ſay <hi>(ibid.)</hi> That <hi>G. W. poſitively Diſowns the words, and Affirms they are None of his, and that he writ not that Part of the Anſwer to</hi> Townſend— <hi>And</hi> G. W. <hi>was ſorry his Name was to that Paper, without Diſtinction between what he writ, and what he did not write in it, wherein
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95758:123"/>thoſe words are which gave the Occaſion. Let this Advertiſement Clear</hi> G. W. <hi>and Others; and ſuffice every Charitable Reader, as we hope it will.</hi> And <hi>G. W.</hi> ſets his Approbation upon the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>To this I ſubſcribe, <hi>George Whitehead.</hi>
                     </hi> And now <hi>George</hi> thinks he is Lick'd <hi>Clean!</hi> No <hi>Spark</hi> of <hi>Dirt</hi> can <hi>Stick</hi> upon him!</p>
                  <p>But how is it that <hi>G. W.</hi> let his <hi>Name</hi> ſtand to this Book for 44 years, without Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of himſelf? or cou'd not his <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Diſcerning</hi> Diſcover this <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> all that time? Eſpecially conſidering that <hi>Chriſtoph. Wade</hi> wrote againſt this Book, and objects this very <hi>Blaſphemy:</hi> And that both <hi>George Fox,</hi> and <hi>George Whitehead</hi> wrote ſeverally <hi>Anſwers</hi> to <hi>Wade;</hi> And yet Neither of them found any Fault with the <hi>Writing</hi> or <hi>Printing</hi> of theſe <hi>Words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if this ſhou'd Clear <hi>G. W.</hi> how will the <hi>Others</hi> get off, upon whom <hi>G. W.</hi> lays the Blame? The <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay, <hi>Let this Advertiſement clear</hi> G. W. <hi>and Others.</hi> And upon the <hi>Title Page</hi> of their Book it is ſaid to be <hi>Sincerely Tendered in behalf of the aforeſaid People, and their Ancient Friends.</hi> Now theſe <hi>Ancient Friends</hi> whoſe <hi>Names</hi> are Affix'd to that <hi>Precious</hi> Book <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> along with <hi>G. W.</hi>'s are here fairly Left in the Lurch, <hi>Diſown'd</hi> and <hi>Abandon'd</hi> with all this <hi>Dreadful Blaſphemy</hi> upon their Heads! And yet they will not <hi>Diſown</hi> them! No. They Pretend to vindicate their <hi>Ancient Friends</hi> ſtill, and that they have not <hi>Chang'd</hi> from the Beginning. As they tell not only in their <hi>Books,</hi> but in the <hi>Printed News-Papers,</hi> that All the World may take Notice of it. They are ſtill <hi>Infallible,</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:95758:124"/>Every <hi>one</hi> of them in <hi>Particular!</hi>

                        <hi>See Sn.</hi> p. 34.284.</note> And they are <hi>Conjurers,</hi> who ſpeak, and not from the <hi>Mouth</hi> of The <hi>Lord.</hi> Now how came <hi>G. W.</hi> to write a Book jointly with <hi>Conjurers?</hi> And to ſet his <hi>Name</hi> to it along with theirs: And that <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diſtinction between what he writ, and what he did not write in it?</hi> For which he ſays now that he is <hi>Sorry.</hi> But they who Jointly <hi>Sign</hi> a <hi>Book,</hi> or a <hi>Bond,</hi> are Anſwerable <hi>Jointly</hi> and <hi>Severally.</hi> Such a Poor <hi>Excuſe</hi> as this cou'd not be taken from any Man of Common <hi>Animadvertence.</hi> For who wou'd ſet his <hi>Name</hi> with others as <hi>Joint Authors</hi> of a Book, if he had not weighed as well what the <hi>others</hi> had wrote, as what Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wrote? Yet this is all the Defence that the <hi>Quaker Infallibility</hi> can make for it ſelf! that is, That it did not <hi>Mind,</hi> but let things <hi>Slip</hi> at <hi>Peradventure!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then, to <hi>Inſcribe</hi> their <hi>Heedleſs, Indigeſted</hi> Stuff as the <hi>Word of the Lord,</hi> which theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> do! This is <hi>Intolerable!</hi> And the <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi> not to be Endur'd!</p>
                  <p>For this, they give ſuch another Excuſe, in the ſame place of <hi>The Chriſtianity of the Quakers.</hi> p. 28. putting it again upon the <hi>Printer.</hi> They ſay that inſtead of <hi>[Which is the Word of the Lord]</hi> it ſhou'd have been <hi>[From the Word]</hi> How ſenſleſs is this! for that which is <hi>[From the Word of the Lord]</hi> is not that <hi>[The Word of the Lord?]</hi> But ſay they, <hi>We ſhall not ſtand by the ſaid Title as 'tis worded without ſuch Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yet Charitably think it was worded Contrary to the Intent and Meaning of the Author.</hi> This is Pretty!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:95758:124"/>But how then came the <hi>Quakers,</hi> even the Great <hi>Fox</hi> himſelf, to ſay of their vile <hi>Scribles,</hi> as they almoſt do every where, <hi>This is the Word of God?</hi> See Inſtances, particularly of <hi>G. Fox</hi> in the <hi>Sn.</hi> p. 89, 90. Can we ſuppoſe that this was <hi>Contrary to the Intent and Meaning of the Author?</hi> How then ſhall we know what was their <hi>Meaning?</hi> They may Alter all their Books, and every word in them. Truly this wou'd be their Beſt way. They will never be Right, or their Books paſſable till this be done. And if we cou'd take them at their Word, they are in a fair way towards it. For here they ſay, That they <hi>will not ſtand by the ſaid</hi> Blurrs <hi>in their</hi> Books, <hi>as 'tis worded, without ſuch Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among other of their <hi>Infallible Errata,</hi> I have ſpy'd <hi>two Letters</hi> in this ſame <hi>Page,</hi> which I ſuppoſe muſt go into the <hi>Basket,</hi> next time the <hi>Duſt-Man</hi> comes about.

                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:95758:125"/>But what <hi>Cauſe</hi> they had to <hi>Aſſure</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of this <hi>G.

                  <p>But to Return; we have ſeen the Silly <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes</hi> which the <hi>Quakers</hi> have made for that Moſt <hi>Horrible</hi> and <hi>Curſed Blaſphemy</hi> before Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which they have Belched out againſt the <hi>H.

                     <hi>G.

In p. 5. ther are theſe words, That <hi>the Chriſtians were not to do any thing in the Name of an Earthly King.</hi> And again, <hi>The ſetting up of theſe Kings and Emperors and Protectors, and giving them the Names of Excellency and Majeſty amongſt the Chriſtians hath been ſince the Days of the Apoſtles amongſt the Apoſtats in the Apoſtacy from the true Wiſdom and Life.</hi> Here he writes upon the <hi>Margin</hi> (I give it you in his own ſpelling) <hi>This was in the Days of</hi> Olefer Cromell <hi>who wou'd be King.</hi> G.

And the like is upon the <hi>Margin</hi> of ſeveral other <hi>Pages.</hi> Now, if this was not Intended for the <hi>Preſs,</hi> it was to give the <hi>Friends</hi> Ground to ſay, that they had ſeen this Expoſition of his, and to make uſe of it, as they ſaw occaſion. But if it was meant (as is moſt likely) to be made Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, the <hi>Friends,</hi> upon ſecond thoughts, found it cou'd not be done, without <hi>Re-Printing</hi> of the Book; which wou'd do them more Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, than ſuch a ſilly <hi>Excuſe</hi> cou'd Heal. Therefore they took the ſafer Courſe, which was, by all the means they cou'd, to <hi>ſtifle</hi> the ſaid Book. And I believe they thought they had Effected it. For having (by ſome Art) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the Book aforeſaid out of the hands of one of themſelves, whom they ſuſpected,

Thus (to give a few more Inſtances) if one ſhou'd Object the Implacable <hi>Rage,</hi> and <hi>Naſtineſs,</hi> of the <hi>Quaker-Spirit,</hi> and Produce what has been herein before Mention'd, what is Quoted in the <hi>Sn.</hi> Sect. xvii. and much more of the ſame Sort that can be Produc'd, they cou'd <hi>Anſwer</hi> All by <hi>Contrary Teſtimonies</hi> (of which they have many) where the <hi>Quakers</hi> do <hi>Abhor</hi> and <hi>Deteſt</hi> ſuch manner of Proceeding, as <hi>Abominable</hi> and <hi>Anti-Chriſtian:</hi> and ſet up Themſelves for all the <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Patience</hi> in the World. Thus in this <hi>Appen.</hi> p. 43. <hi>Sam.

Second Edit. <hi>They that are Angrie for God, Paſſionate for Chriſt, that call names for Religion — may tell us they are Chriſtians, if they will, but no body wou'd know them to be ſuch, by their Fruits: To be ſure, they are no Chriſtians of Chriſt's making.</hi> He gave this <hi>Title</hi> to

                  <p>And now, what wou'd you have more? Do's it not Plainly follow from hence, That neither <hi>Will.

Penn</hi> ſets down an <hi>Objection</hi> of <hi>T. Hicks</hi>'s, That the <hi>Great</hi> Quaker <hi>Ed.

Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Darkneſs is Reſerved for thee. Thou art a Serpent. And the Curſe of God is Eternally upon thee. Thou Beaſt, to whom the Plagues of God are Due.</hi> Now theſe look very like <hi>Ill Names,</hi> and <hi>Railing,</hi> to be ſure, they are <hi>Reviling.</hi> What ſays <hi>Will. Penn</hi> to this? He ſays, That this was the Fitteſt <hi>Return</hi> cou'd be made to the <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which <hi>P. Bennet</hi> put to <hi>Ed. Burrough.</hi> Why? were they <hi>Rude</hi> or <hi>Reflecting</hi> Queſtions? No. for, <hi>W. P.</hi> confeſſes p. 164. 165. that they were <hi>Civil,</hi> no <hi>Railing</hi> or <hi>Reviling</hi> in them, but that he <hi>Queries ſmoothly.</hi> And therefore calls him a <hi>White Devil,</hi> and the more <hi>Serpentine</hi> for that. However a <hi>Civil Queſtion,</hi> Deſerves a <hi>Civil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi> But <hi>Civil</hi> Queſtions Provoke the <hi>Quakers</hi> moſt; becauſe it is hardeſt to <hi>Raile</hi> at them,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95758:132"/>without which the <hi>Quakers</hi> cannot Anſwer. Therefore <hi>W. P.</hi> calls <hi>Bennet</hi>'s <hi>Civil Queſtions Inſnaring</hi> and <hi>Trapanning</hi> Queſtions. i. e. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gly</hi> Hard <hi>Queſtions!</hi> they are to be ſeen in <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>'s works. They are very <hi>Sober</hi> and <hi>Pertinent</hi> Queſtions, therefore were <hi>Troubleſome</hi> to <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But <hi>Truth</hi> is not Eaſily <hi>Inſnar'd,</hi> nor is Afraid of <hi>Queſtions.</hi> Theſe Rather make <hi>Truth</hi> appear the more. And it looks like <hi>Guilt,</hi> to Return <hi>Railing</hi> and <hi>Reviling:</hi> And that is the Method, which <hi>Will. Penn</hi> Condemns here as <hi>Anti-Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi> Yet concerning the aforeſaid <hi>Railing</hi> of <hi>Burrough</hi> againſt <hi>Bennet, W. Penn</hi> ſays, p. 164. <hi>I warrant it, from God, and by the ſence of His Eternal Spirit do Declare, That it was the Portion, and only fit Anſwer to be given to thoſe Trapan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Queſtions.</hi> What! Better than a Sober <hi>Solution</hi> to ſuch <hi>Queſtions,</hi> let them be never ſo <hi>Trapanning?</hi> Had not this been the beſt way to have Diſcover'd their <hi>Deceit;</hi> and <hi>Convinc'd,</hi> or elſe <hi>Confounded</hi> the <hi>Adverſary,</hi> and left him without <hi>Excuſe?</hi> No. Says <hi>Will. Penn</hi> (ibid) <hi>Had</hi> Ed. Burrough <hi>gone into a familiar opening to his</hi> (Bennet<hi>'s</hi>) <hi>Vulturous, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean, Serpentine Eye</hi> — what then? <hi>E. B. had brought the wrath of the Eternal God upon Himſelf, inſtead of the Prieſt.</hi> Thus <hi>W. Penn.</hi> So that, ſometimes, for the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> to Anſwer <hi>Soberly,</hi> without <hi>Railing,</hi> is to bring the <hi>wrath</hi> of <hi>God</hi> upon <hi>Themſelves!</hi> and that is, when ſuch <hi>Inſnaring</hi> and <hi>Trapanning Queſtions</hi> are put to them, as will not Admit of a <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Direct</hi> Anſwer, without Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Iniquity.</hi> But that is not the Point now. It is not, what <hi>Excuſe</hi> they may have for their <hi>Railing,</hi> which none
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95758:132"/>afford ſo <hi>Liberally</hi> to their <hi>Opponents</hi> as the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers:</hi> But is not <hi>Railing, Railing,</hi> be it in whom it will? was not this <hi>Reviling</hi> in <hi>W. P.</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Juſtifie</hi> the <hi>Revilings</hi> of <hi>E.

No. He Proteſts to the Contrary (<hi>ibid.</hi> p. 166.) <hi>God is my Record</hi> (ſays he) <hi>this Day, I wou'd not, to Inherit more worlds than ther are Stars in the Firmament, have ſo Violated the Laws of Charity, againſt the moſt violent of our Deceaſed Oppoſers.</hi> Therefore, who can believe that ſuch a Good man as this wou'd <hi>Raile,</hi> or <hi>Revile</hi> any Body! And he did juſtly Correct <hi>T.

                     <hi>Book, That if he had Treated that Accurſed ſtock of Hirelings</hi> (the Clergy) <hi>ten Thouſand times more ſharply, it had been but Enough.</hi> That was All! And to be Accus'd of <hi>Railing</hi> or <hi>Reviling</hi> for this! But he went further in his <hi>Serious Apology,</hi> p. 156. <hi>And I wou'd ſay not Enough</hi> (continues he) <hi>but that the Reverence I bear to the Holy Spirit wou'd oblige me to Acquieſce in whatever He ſhou'd utter thro' any Prophet or Servant of the Lord.</hi> Here is Aſcribing all their <hi>Railing</hi> to the <hi>Holy Spirit!</hi> But <hi>W.

And is ther no <hi>Contradiction</hi> in all this? No. Far from it!</p>
                  <p>For this is one of the Main <hi>Heads,</hi> upon which he Proves <hi>Thom. Hicks</hi> not to be a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> In the ſame <hi>Reaſon againſt Railing.</hi> p. 124. thus. <hi>He that Contradicts himſelf, is not led by God's Spirit, and Conſequently, No Child of God, nor Certain Rule of their own Faith: but ſo doth</hi> T.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95758:133"/>will not ſay, How Patly this might be Retort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But I wou'd Recommend to <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s ſecond Thoughts, the Inference he makes againſt <hi>T. Hicks</hi> for all this, p. 167. <hi>No man can be ſecure of him in Common Converſe, who, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs his End, upon ſuch as oppoſe him, will ſelf-Contradict, Pervert, Ly, Forge: beyond which, in this World, is nothing but direct Murder. And that's a Queſtion, ſince, in ſome caſes, it were leſs Irkſome to Dy, than to be Defamed. Is this doing as Men wou'd be done to?</hi> &amp;c. Apply this to <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s uſage of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and others, in what is above Quoted, and much more of the ſame ſtrain, that might be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd out of his Writings.</p>
                  <p>What can we ſay, to Reconcile theſe things, but that the <hi>Quakers</hi> think None but Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Raile?</hi> or that it is not <hi>Railing,</hi> if it comes from Them, but Pure <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs?</hi> thus,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>The Saints may do the ſame things, by</l>
                     <l>The Spirit, in Sincerity,</l>
                     <l>Which other men are Tempted to,</l>
                     <l>And at the Devil's Inſtance do.</l>

                  <p>But I have an <hi>Apology</hi> for Mr. <hi>Penn,</hi> Which I think Real. He tells us, in his <hi>Reaſon againſt Railing.</hi> p. 171. That he was then about 29 years of Age. This was Printed <hi>An</hi> 1673. And his <hi>Guide Miſtaken</hi> before Quoted p. 34. was Printed <hi>An.</hi> 1668. When he was but 24 years of Age. He was then in the <hi>Heat</hi> of <hi>Youth,</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:95758:134"/>and a <hi>New Convert</hi> to <hi>Quakeriſm;</hi> And it is uſual with ſuch, to <hi>Exceed</hi> in <hi>Zeal.</hi> But ſince, he has had time to <hi>Cool.</hi> And his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, of Late years, ſo much at <hi>Court,</hi> has <hi>ſoftn'd</hi> his <hi>Temper,</hi> and let him ſee the <hi>Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> of <hi>Rudeneſs</hi> and <hi>Scurrility</hi> (which has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln moſt of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> Principally from their want of <hi>Breeding</hi>) Inſomuch that I am very Apt to Perſwade my ſelf, He is Inwardly <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd</hi> of theſe things; and wiſhes they had never been wrote. And this appears much in the Difference of his <hi>Stile</hi> in his <hi>Addreſs to Proteſtants,</hi> and more, in his Excellent <hi>Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Maxims,</hi> from that <hi>vehemence,</hi> not to ſay <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> that Runs thro' all his <hi>Former</hi> writings. If it be ſaid, why if I think thus, I ſhou'd Preſs ſo hard upon Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> now? why, truely, to Reſcue him even by <hi>Force,</hi> from among That <hi>Ill-bred Pedantick Crew.</hi> He will not take theſe words ill, for a Reaſon he knows <hi>(Sauce for a Gooſe, is Sauſe for a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)</hi> But they have <hi>Chain'd</hi> him with <hi>Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> (fond to get a Man of <hi>Senſe</hi> of their Party) and, Perhaps, with Hopes of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Heirſhip.</hi> But theſe, I ſuppoſe, are not ſo Conſiderable to him, as to ſtand by all his <hi>former</hi> writings, and come under the <hi>Cenſure</hi> (now Repeated) which he (for much leſs Reaſon) has Paſs'd upon <hi>T. Hicks.</hi> But, which is Infinitly of more weight, I <hi>Conjure</hi> him to Conſider, what Account he muſt Give, before the Great <hi>Judge,</hi> if, by his <hi>Example,</hi> or <hi>Silence,</hi> not <hi>Publickly</hi> to <hi>Retract</hi> his <hi>Errors,</hi> he <hi>Confirm</hi> ſo many poor <hi>Souls,</hi> that have given up their <hi>Judgments</hi> to him, in thoſe Deſtructive <hi>Doctrins</hi> (which he cannot

                  </p>
                  <p>For this Reaſon, I have Inſiſted ſo long upon Mr. <hi>Penn</hi>'s <hi>Contradictions,</hi> and <hi>Contrary Teſtimonies:</hi> and <hi>Repeated</hi> ſome <hi>Quotations</hi> of thoſe above, which are in the <hi>Sn.</hi> in <hi>Sat.

Fox,</hi> in his <hi>Iconoclaſtes,</hi> making it <hi>Heatheniſm</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> to Paint the <hi>Likeneſs</hi> of any <hi>Creature</hi> upon a <hi>Sign;</hi> they can Reconcile this by ſhewing the <hi>Contrary Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> of the <hi>Quakers Practiſe</hi> at this Day, who have <hi>Signs</hi> of <hi>Lyons, Bulls, Bears,</hi> &amp;c. like the <hi>People</hi> of the <hi>World;</hi> nay more, They can Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a <hi>Contrary Teſtimony,</hi> even at that Time when this <hi>Iconoclaſtes</hi> was Printed, of—a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> who, at the <hi>meeting of Sufferings,</hi> where this matter was Debated being of a Contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from <hi>G. Fox,</hi> ask'd one of <hi>Fox's</hi> Party for a Piece of <hi>Money:</hi> And ſhewing it, told them that they muſt, by this Rule, throw away all their <hi>Money,</hi> becauſe ther were <hi>Images</hi> upon them, of <hi>Men, Lyons, Flowers,</hi> &amp;c. But this (tho' an Unanſwerable Argument to them) yet cou'd not Prevail. And notwithſtanding of all this, they will not own that they are all of them <hi>Idolaters,</hi> who have <hi>Money,</hi> or <hi>Signs</hi> of <hi>Bulls, Bears</hi> &amp;c. no nor that <hi>G. Fox</hi> was <hi>Miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;</hi> Becauſe he Dictated this as from the Mouth of the <hi>Lord God!</hi> as he did All that he wrote; and ſet down this as a ſtanding Rule, That whoever ſpeak, and not from the <hi>Mouth of the Lord,</hi> are <hi>Falſe Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Conjurers,</hi> in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95758:136"/>his <hi>Saul's Errand.</hi> p. 7. And his <hi>Anſwer to the Weſtmorland Petition.</hi> p. 5. And the Conſequence is Undeniable, that the Preſent <hi>Quakers</hi> are <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Idolaters,</hi> or otherwiſe that <hi>G. Fox</hi> their Great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> and <hi>Founder</hi> was a <hi>Falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> and a <hi>Conjurer.</hi> This is the uſe all Men of Senſe can make of their <hi>Contrary Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> which they Produce as their <hi>Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Thus, if we object their not taking off their <hi>Hats,</hi> and paying <hi>Civil Honour</hi> to <hi>Men:</hi> They can ſhew the <hi>Contrary Teſtimony</hi> of their Dayly <hi>Practiſe,</hi> in making their <hi>Apprentices</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> ſtand <hi>Bare</hi> in their Preſence. The Myſtery is, They are againſt <hi>Paying</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> but not againſt <hi>Receiving</hi> it. Eſpecially from the <hi>Wicked,</hi> it is moſt Due from Them to the <hi>Saints!</hi> Therefore tho' they <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> the <hi>Worlds People,</hi> yet they do not care to be <hi>Thou'd</hi> by them. They Love very well to be <hi>Maſter'd</hi> and <hi>Miſtreſs'd</hi> by them. And will ſay to them ſometimes, when they call the <hi>Quakers</hi> (after their own faſhion) by their Bare (I had almoſt ſaid <hi>Chriſten'd</hi>) Names, why do'ſt thee ſpeak our Language, ſeeing thee do'ſt allow of giving Titles? Thee ſhoud'ſt ſpeak in the Language thee do'ſt approve of.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Again, if you object the <hi>Common Place</hi> which All the <hi>Quakers</hi> Inſiſted upon ſo much, at the Beginning, when they were <hi>Poor,</hi> That it was <hi>Anti-Chriſtian</hi> for any Man to Sue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at Law; And a Plain mark of the <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of the <hi>World:</hi> In the Deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of whom, <hi>G.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95758:136"/>
                     <hi>Abominable</hi> Practiſes (as he Reckon'd them) ſets this down as a Main one, Theſe wicked Folks <hi>Are ſuch</hi> (ſays he) <hi>as Sue Men at the Law, which Chriſt forbade.</hi> Yet now that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are Grown <hi>Rich,</hi> and have ſomething to <hi>Sue</hi> for, They <hi>Sue</hi> as faſt as the <hi>World's People.</hi> Yet this is no <hi>Contradiction</hi> to their <hi>Principle!</hi> No. But only a <hi>Contrary Teſtimony,</hi> to Clear the other when Objected.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. 1. If you object their not obſerving of <hi>Times,</hi> Set apart by the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>Feſtivals</hi> &amp;c. They can ſhew the <hi>Contrary Principle</hi> of their <hi>General Councils,</hi> their <hi>Yearly Meetings</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> which they always Appoint to be Celebrated in <hi>Whitſon-Week,</hi> that being the <hi>Great Feſtival</hi> ordained to be kept in Memory of the Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Deſcent of the Holy <hi>Ghoſt</hi> upon the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> at the <hi>Feaſt</hi> of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> If it be ſaid, That this time is appointed only upon Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Seaſon of the Year, becauſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> come yearly to attend this their <hi>moſt Solemn Meeting</hi> from <hi>Foreign Countries,</hi> even from the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> That Excuſe will not do, for this <hi>Feaſt</hi> is <hi>Movable,</hi> ſometimes a <hi>Months</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; And if they Reſpected only the <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of the <hi>Year,</hi> they wou'd keep to ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Month</hi> that all might know: But that they ſhou'd <hi>Always</hi> ſtumble juſt upon <hi>Whitſun-Week,</hi> will not paſs merely upon <hi>Chance:</hi> But their Reaſon is plainly, becauſe they Pretend to the Greateſt <hi>Effuſions</hi> of the Holy <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> which they have made Peculiar to <hi>Themſelves:</hi> And therefore keep their <hi>General Meetings</hi> in <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſun-Week,</hi> and at no other time; which is a moſt <hi>Solemn Obſervation</hi> of that <hi>Great Feſtival</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:95758:137"/>of the <hi>Church.</hi> And yet they Exclaim moſt Bitterly againſt the <hi>Obſervation</hi> of <hi>Times,</hi> as being <hi>Carnal,</hi> and forſaking of the <hi>Truth</hi> &amp;c. Nay <hi>G. Fox,</hi> in his <hi>News out of the North.</hi> p. 23. Names <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> with <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> and <hi>Eaſter,</hi> among the <hi>Holy-Days</hi> which he Runs down.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They now Generally obſerve <hi>The Lord's Day</hi> for their <hi>Publick Worſhip:</hi> But if any ſhou'd object this, as an <hi>Obſervation</hi> of <hi>Times,</hi> they have <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies</hi> to Produce, where the <hi>Quakers</hi> have <hi>Preach'd</hi> and <hi>Printed</hi> againſt the obſervation of <hi>That Day,</hi> as <hi>Superſtitious, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> and others of their <hi>Prophets,</hi> have got themſelves into <hi>Churches,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the People Met, and carry'd with them, a Pair of <hi>Briches, Gloves,</hi> or ſomething of their <hi>Trades,</hi> and ſet themſelves in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Communion-Table,</hi> and there were found buſie at work, when the People came to <hi>Church;</hi> and ſome of them have Opened their <hi>Shops</hi> on that Day, purpoſely as a <hi>Contempt</hi> of the <hi>Day,</hi> and to bear their <hi>Teſtimony</hi> againſt it. Which <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> Vindicates in his <hi>Truth Defending the Quakers.</hi> Printed 1659. p. 20. 21. where he Repeats this Queſtion that was put to him. <hi>Did that</hi> Quaker <hi>Sin therein or not, who brought lately on the Lord's Day an old Dublet into Dr.</hi> Gell<hi>'s Church in</hi> London; <hi>and ſat upon the</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Table, <hi>mending it, while the Doctor was Preaching, the Pariſhioners forbidding him?</hi> And his Anſwer is in theſe words. <hi>What, wilt thou Continue a</hi> Papiſt, <hi>that thou Counteſt it ſuch a Great Crime to</hi> Work <hi>upon the</hi> Communion Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95758:137"/>
                     <hi>as if it were a more Holy Place than another? And, like a</hi> Papiſt, <hi>thou calleſt the</hi> Steeple-Houſe <hi>the</hi> Church; <hi>which thou haſt no Scripture for. And if any</hi> Quaker <hi>did as thou ſayeſt, whether thinkeſt thou, was his working there, or a</hi> Prieſt<hi>'s Preaching for Money and ſetting forth his ware to Sale there (as in the Market-houſe) the Greater offence? And where do'ſt thou Read in Scripture, that men muſt do no work on the Firſt days of the week?</hi> Thus he. Yet now the <hi>Quakers</hi> Ceaſe from <hi>Work</hi> on that <hi>Day:</hi> And ſet up for the Obſervation of it, as well as others. Tho' formerly, they us'd to make up their <hi>Accounts</hi> on that Day, to Pay and Receive Money &amp;c. which I can Prove from thoſe to whom they have come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Errand. But to ſave them on all ſides, the <hi>Quaker</hi> Infallible <hi>Spirit</hi> can go both ways, <hi>For</hi> and <hi>Against</hi> the Obſervation of the <hi>Lord's-Day:</hi> And <hi>Both</hi> as Directed by the ſame <hi>Spirit.</hi> Thus <hi>G. Fox</hi> Determins in what he calls <hi>An Epistle to All the Christian Magistrates and Powers in the whole Christendom.</hi> London. <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> An. 1659. p. 12. <hi>So all Friends</hi> (ſays he) <hi>of the Lord God, that be Moved to ſet open your Shops, or to do any work on the</hi> Firſt Day, <hi>which the falſe Christians call their</hi> Sabbath— <hi>Do not ye Judge all that do not as ye do, that be not moved to do the Service as ye are to do that Day; And all that doth not do that ſervice on that Day as ye do, as are not moved by the Power of the Lord God, do not Judge them that doth ſuch a Service on that Day.</hi> Here he makes them the <hi>Falſe-Christians</hi> who call the <hi>First-Day</hi> their Day of <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Rest.</hi> And if the <hi>calling</hi> it ſo be ſuch a <hi>Crime,</hi> ſure the <hi>Obſervation</hi> of it,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95758:138"/>as ſuch, muſt be much Greater. Yet he <hi>Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi> gives the <hi>Quakers</hi> leave to be ſuch <hi>Falſe-Chriſtians,</hi> if their <hi>Light</hi> ſo Direct. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, That their <hi>Light</hi> is Equally <hi>Infallible</hi> when it Commands <hi>Contradictions!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But he caſts the Ballance againſt the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Christian Sabbath:</hi> only wou'd not have thoſe <hi>Precious ones</hi> to be <hi>Judged</hi> who do <hi>Obſerve</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>I cannot Refrain from giving you his <hi>Reaſon</hi> againſt the Obſervation of it, which is Worthy of his <hi>Infallibility!</hi> You will find it in his <hi>Great Myſtery.</hi> p. 101. <hi>viz.</hi> That it was not the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth</hi> but the <hi>Eighth</hi> Day. That is, It was the <hi>Eighth</hi> of the <hi>Seven</hi> Days! Unleſs the <hi>Quakers</hi> make more than <hi>Seven</hi> Days in a <hi>Week.</hi> And if it was the <hi>Eighth</hi> Day, why do the <hi>Quakers</hi> call it the <hi>Firſt</hi> Day? But it is well enough, if the <hi>Light</hi> ſo Direct! Was this too from <hi>The Mouth</hi> of <hi>The Lord!</hi> Yea <hi>Verily!</hi> or elſe <hi>G. Fox</hi> has Decreed <hi>Himſelf</hi> to be a <hi>Conjurer.</hi> But the beſt of it is, No body will believe him, who ever knew him, or have Read his Books.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. 1. Let me give Another <hi>Inſtance</hi> of the <hi>Contrary Teſtimonies</hi> of the <hi>Quakers.</hi> At their firſt ſetting up, when they were <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly,</hi> it was their Conſtant <hi>Theam</hi> to <hi>Rail</hi> at <hi>Fine Houſes,</hi> and <hi>Costly Furniture,</hi> particularly againſt <hi>Coaches,</hi> which they Deſpis'd, as the <hi>Fox</hi> did the <hi>Grapes</hi> that were out of his Reach. They made theſe the Infallible Marks of <hi>Pride,</hi> and of <hi>The worlds People.</hi> No man Denies but that <hi>Pride</hi> is a <hi>Sin:</hi> And that Men may be <hi>Proud</hi> of theſe things. But the <hi>Quakers</hi> made the <hi>Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of theſe things, or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſing</hi> of them to be <hi>Pride.</hi> They Pupliſh'd a Book with this Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent

An. 1655. which Begins thus, <hi>Wo unto you that are called Lords, Ladies, Knights, Gentlemen, and Gentlewomen, in reſpect to your Perſons</hi>— <hi>who are called of men, Master, and Sir, and Mistriſs, and Madam</hi>— <hi>And you must have your Wine and Ale, and all your Dainty Diſhes</hi>— <hi>And you have your Fine Attire, Silk, Velvet, and Purple, Gold and Silver; and you have your waiting-Men, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Maids under you to waite upon you; and your Coaches to Ride in, and your High and Lofty Horſes</hi>— <hi>And here you are Lords over your fellow Creatures, and they must Bow and Crouch to you</hi>— <hi>And you will be called</hi> Maſters— <hi>upholding that which Christ in his Doctrin forbids, who ſaith,</hi> Be not ye called Maſters— <hi>The Lord abhors all your Profeſſion</hi>— <hi>Your Works are the Works of the Devil</hi> —<hi>in your Dainty Diſhes</hi>— <hi>in your Lofty Horſes, in your Curious Buildings, in your Earthly Honour, which is all the fruits of the</hi> Devil— <hi>You are too High, and Fine, and too Lofty to Enter in at the straight Gate</hi> &amp;c.</p>

They were their own <hi>waiting-Men</hi> and <hi>waiting-Maids!</hi> And Rode upon their own <hi>Hobby-Horſes!</hi> None of them had been in the In-ſide of a <hi>Coach!</hi> That was an <hi>Exaltation</hi> far above their Thoughts!

But you muſt not call them <hi>Coaches,</hi> for that Name they had vilify'd, and given it for a <hi>Mark</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> But, as one of them ſaid, when his <hi>Coach</hi> was objected to him, as <hi>Contrary</hi> to their <hi>Ancient Teſtimonies,</hi> he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, That it was not a <hi>Coach,</hi> only a <hi>Leathern-Convenience.</hi> Like the <hi>Traveller</hi> who told that they had no <hi>Knives</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> And being ask'd How they cut their Meat?

                  <p n="2">2. Ther was nothing they <hi>Inveg'd</hi> againſt more ſeverely than the uſe of <hi>Periwigs. G. Fox</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:95758:139"/>had a Mind to be a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> like <hi>Samſon,</hi> and wore <hi>Long</hi> ſtreight <hi>Hair</hi> like <hi>Rats-Tayls,</hi> juſt as <hi>Muggleton</hi> did. But <hi>Will. Penn</hi> coming in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Naſty Herd,</hi> cou'd not ſo eaſily forget his <hi>Genteel</hi> Education.

G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> himſelf is come into it. Therefore I muſt Mind them of their Ancient <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> againſt it.

But I wou'd not Force it upon him, therefore I have put it, where he may Read it, or Let it alone. There the <hi>Quakers</hi> make the wearing of a <hi>Wig</hi> to be downright <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Confuſion.</hi> And bring ſeveral <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> to Prove it. They Compare thoſe that wear them to <hi>Hermophradites,</hi> and (for <hi>Rime</hi>) to <hi>Catamites.</hi> Nay they make them <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> to ſhew their <hi>Wit:</hi> and that you might not loſe the <hi>Jeſt,</hi> they put <hi>Calvus, Bald</hi> upon the <hi>Margin.</hi> So all that <hi>Shave</hi> their <hi>Heads</hi> are <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> This too was from the <hi>Mouth</hi> of <hi>The Lord!</hi> They Abuſe the <hi>Clergy</hi> for wearing <hi>Wiggs,</hi> ay and of a <hi>Light Colour</hi> too!

This pretence for Pride</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is no better than what is for Drunkeneſs and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> And they Propoſe the Example of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> who (as they have found it out) wore no <hi>Wigg,</hi> when the Children call'd him <hi>Bald-Head!</hi> And they do not beleve that <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> wore <hi>Wiggs!</hi> For if they had, then (ſay they very <hi>Smartly</hi>) The <hi>Women Chriſtians</hi> might have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted upon them thus, <hi>Was that the Cauſe,</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>and</hi> Paul, <hi>that you bad <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s leave off our Locks, that you, and ſuch like, might get them your Selves, to make</hi> Periwiggs <hi>of?</hi> Now may not the <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

They Examin another Excuſe for <hi>Wiggs.</hi> viz. <hi>Some ſay, ſhaving is to Prevent the Pox.</hi> To which they Anſwer, <hi>Small honour to wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearers, to Incur ſuch a ſuſpicion of it.</hi> This <hi>ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> comes Near ſome of the moſt Able <hi>Holders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth</hi> among the <hi>Quaking-Friends.</hi> See <hi>Sn.</hi> p. 4.7. I know not whether <hi>G. Archer,</hi> or if <hi>C.

And a <hi>Quaker</hi> ſaid lately at the <hi>Conference</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> That he was at Laſt <hi>Hanged</hi> for a <hi>High-way-Man.</hi> (A pretty <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> for a <hi>Quaker Apoſtle!</hi>) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they did <hi>Diſown</hi> him. It was full time! They will Quit any of their <hi>Friends</hi> at the <hi>Gallows.</hi> But they will not yet <hi>Diſown</hi> his <hi>Books,</hi> which <hi>G. Fox, G. Whitehead</hi> &amp;c. have <hi>Defended</hi> and owned. For then they muſt diſown <hi>Fox, Whitehead, Howgil,</hi> and <hi>Burrough,</hi> &amp;c. who wrote a <hi>Preface</hi> to one of his Books, call'd <hi>The Standard of the Lord:</hi> And with 15 or 16 more of the Eminent <hi>Quakers,</hi> Subſcrib'd to it. And they never Diſown'd any of <hi>Atkinſon</hi>'s Books, but Defended and Juſtify'd them, when the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> brought <hi>Quotations</hi> out of them. But to Return.</p>
                  <p>In that <hi>Precious Declaration</hi> againſt <hi>Wiggs,</hi> it is ſaid, That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> went with <hi>Sandabs,</hi> and a <hi>Single Coat, whoſe Examples the famouſeſt Primitive Chriſtians followed</hi>— yea, and <hi>Primitive Quakers</hi> too! who Generally went <hi>Bare-foot,</hi> becauſe they had no <hi>Shoos:</hi> And few of them
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95758:141"/>were Worth <hi>Two Coats,</hi> or had <hi>one</hi> Good <hi>one.</hi> Which might have been one of the Cauſes, why they brought up the faſhion of going <hi>Nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> And they Urg'd the Example too of the <hi>Prophets</hi> for that!</p>
                  <p>They Boaſt <hi>(ibid.)</hi> how <hi>John Millner,</hi> a Friend <hi>about</hi> Northampton, a <hi>Wigg-maker, left off his Trade, and was made to Burn one in his Prenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſight, and Print againſt it.</hi> And that <hi>John Hall,</hi> a <hi>Gentleman of</hi> Northumberland, <hi>being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, ſitting at a Meeting, was ſhaken by the Lords Power, Pluck'd off, and threw down his</hi> Wigg. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When ſhall we ſee ſuch a <hi>Power</hi> in the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker-Meetings</hi> now? To ſee their <hi>Wiggs</hi> fly about, or left for <hi>Mops</hi> to clean the Houſe, and they come out all <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s! They muſt do this, or elſe Renounce their <hi>Ancient Friends,</hi> and their <hi>Precious Teſtimonies.</hi> Elſe that is not True, which they ſay in their <hi>yearly Epiſtle</hi> for the year 1696, That <hi>what</hi> their Light <hi>Convinced them of to be Evil in the Beginning, it Reproves ſtill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it Convinced them of theſe things, <hi>Fine-Houſes, Coaches, Wiggs,</hi> &amp;c, That they were <hi>very Evil!</hi> In <hi>The Trumpet of the Lord Blown,</hi> before Quoted, p. 2. They made All thoſe to be mere <hi>Heathens</hi> who us'd theſe things, eſpecially the <hi>Prieſts</hi> who Suffer'd them. Thus ſay they, <hi>And you ſay, he is a Miniſter of Chriſt, and he ſaith you are Christians, Whereas you are All</hi> Heathens, <hi>both Priest and People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo ſure were the <hi>Quakers</hi> then of the Truth of this, And of the Force of theſe their <hi>Doughty</hi> Arguments, That they ſay (<hi>ibid.</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:95758:141"/>p. 5.) <hi>And if you will not believe this, you wou'd not believe</hi> Dives <hi>and he ſhou'd Riſe from the Dead.</hi> Yet ther are not now more <hi>Dives</hi>'s among any ſort of People than the <hi>Quakers!</hi> They are <hi>Rich,</hi> and fare <hi>Sumptuouſly.</hi> And they Direct theſe their <hi>Dictates</hi> to <hi>Christ</hi> Himſelf; for thus ſay they <hi>(ibid.) To the Light in all your Conſciences I ſpeak.</hi> Now they make this <hi>Light</hi> to be <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> Himſelf. And thus they take upon them to <hi>Instruct</hi> and <hi>Teach</hi> the <hi>Light!</hi> This Confounds All their <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Teaching.</hi> For has the <hi>Light,</hi> has <hi>Christ</hi> need of being <hi>Taught</hi> by <hi>Them!</hi> But this belongs to another Head. And is ſpoke of in <hi>Prim. Heres.</hi> to which this <hi>Appendix</hi> is ſaid to be an <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But ſays nothing to it. Therefore I Return, and go on with the Preſent Subject.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Their <hi>Primitive Principle</hi> was, That none ſhou'd <hi>Preach</hi> or <hi>Pray</hi> but as the <hi>Spirit</hi> mov'd them. And they brought it as an Argument againſt all other <hi>Profeſſions,</hi> that they did not <hi>Preach</hi> &amp;c. by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> becauſe they had ſet and ſtated <hi>Times</hi> for it, as if the <hi>Spirit</hi> were oblig'd to come at their Appointment. Yet now the <hi>Spirit</hi> moves <hi>Them</hi> juſt at ſuch <hi>Times</hi> as they Appoint: And they have their <hi>Stated Days</hi> and <hi>Hours</hi> of <hi>Worſhip</hi> like other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. They now <hi>Swear</hi> in the ſame <hi>Terms,</hi> which before they Declar'd to be a Direct <hi>Oath;</hi> and yet Pretend to ſtand ſtill to their former <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> againſt the Lawfulneſs of taking an <hi>Oath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:95758:142"/>It wou'd be Endleſs to Purſue their <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,</hi> ſee a <hi>Catalogue</hi> that Mr. <hi>Peniman</hi> has Printed of them.</p>
                  <p>This I hope will be ſufficient to ſhew, that the Method taken in this <hi>Antidote</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix,</hi> of bringing <hi>Contrary Teſtimonies,</hi> is no Clearing of the Objections brought againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> while they Refuſe to <hi>Diſown</hi> thoſe <hi>Hereſies</hi> &amp;c. which are plainly Prov'd upon them. It is as if a Man Accus'd of <hi>Treaſon</hi> ſhou'd bring <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> where he ſpoke <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably</hi> of the <hi>King;</hi> but did not offer to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove any Part of the <hi>Evidence</hi> brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Double meanings and Croſs-purpoſes.</note>4. Ther is another <hi>Method</hi> of Great ſervice to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in <hi>Anſwering</hi> their <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> and Deceiving of them, which is The <hi>Double-Meanings</hi> they have in their words: whereby, tho' they ſpeak the ſame <hi>Words</hi> that you do; and know your <hi>Meaning</hi> fully in them: yet they <hi>Mean</hi> them in a Quite <hi>Different Senſe:</hi> And ſo, in <hi>Quakers Plaineſs,</hi> make their <hi>Eſcape!</hi> But ther being ſo much ſaid of this, in the <hi>Firſt Part</hi> §. v. p. 9. &amp;c. I need Add no more here; tho' I cou'd Exemplify this their <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> in Many other Inſtances, were I not Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Reader's Labour, and Mine own. And that I think theſe are ſufficient, at leaſt, till Anſwer'd.</p>
                  <p>Ther is Another <hi>Trick</hi> of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> may come in with this Head; And I cannot give it a Better Name, than <hi>Croſs-Purpoſes,</hi> that is, They will not Anſwer <hi>Directly,</hi> but, as we ſay, <hi>About the Buſh.</hi> But ther is always a <hi>Reaſon</hi> for it, when they ſo do. Thus if you Ask them,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95758:142"/>whether they are <hi>Perfect, even as God?</hi> They will Anſwer, <hi>Be ye Perfect as your Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Perfect.</hi> And, <hi>As He is, ſo are we in this World.</hi> If you Ask whether the <hi>very Body of Chriſt, Fleſh, Blood and Bones, be in them?</hi> They will Anſwer, <hi>We are Bone of His Bone, and Fleſh of His Fleſh.</hi> If you ask, How they Underſtand theſe <hi>Scriptures?</hi> whether <hi>Strictly</hi> and in a <hi>Literal</hi> Senſe? They will Anſwer, <hi>Let him that Readeth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand.</hi> And, <hi>He that hath Ears to Hear, let Him Hear.</hi> And no other ſatisfaction will you get from them. But the meaning is, They Dare not Aſſert their <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> Broad-Fac'd: And wou'd thus <hi>Hide</hi> them. But this ſhews them Plain; And to what Senſe they <hi>wreſt</hi> the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which they thus Quote. Theſe are the ſort of <hi>Anſwers</hi> you will Generally find in <hi>Fox</hi>'s Gr. <hi>Myſtery.</hi> But we know what they <hi>Hold,</hi> by what they <hi>Oppoſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of a Kin with this, is their never failing <hi>Allegories,</hi> by the Force of which they can <hi>Wreſt</hi> any <hi>Text</hi> in <hi>Scripture, From</hi> or <hi>To</hi> what Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they Fancy. Much has been ſaid as to this Point, in their turning the <hi>Humanity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> His <hi>Birth, Paſſion, Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our <hi>Bodies,</hi> and <hi>Future Judgment;</hi> with the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>The Lord's Supper,</hi> and other <hi>outward Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> into an <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Allegorical</hi> Senſe, to the Total overthrow of the Whole <hi>Chriſtian Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I find ſome Pleaſant Inſtances of this Kind, in <hi>William Haworth</hi> his <hi>Quaker Converted to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</hi> An. 1674. p. 7. 8. of his Prefatory Epiſtle to <hi>John Crook.</hi> Where the <hi>Quakers</hi> turn

                  <p>See in the <hi>First Part.</hi> p. 32, 33. the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker-Interpretation</hi> of <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 13. <hi>Curſed is Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that Hangeth on a Tree.</hi> i. e. on the <hi>Tree</hi> of <hi>Knowlege,</hi> that is, what <hi>Knowlege</hi> is got by the outward <hi>Carnal</hi> means of <hi>Hearing, Reading, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing</hi> &amp;c.

But here is that <hi>Carnal</hi> thing of <hi>Knowlege, Wiſdom, Reaſon</hi> (their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Foe</hi>) <hi>Hang'd</hi> and <hi>Crucify'd,</hi> as before they

Here is Their <hi>Plain, Eaſie, Natural</hi> way of <hi>Interpreting</hi> the <hi>Scripture!</hi> But why ſhou'd it be <hi>Natural?</hi> For the <hi>Natural</hi> Man knoweth not the things of <hi>God!</hi> And the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Killeth! Therefore they will take Nothing according to the <hi>Letter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But they Miſtake the <hi>Letter,</hi> or the <hi>Spelling</hi> ſometimes. As one that I have ſeen, who late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being Preſs'd with <hi>Chriſt</hi> being ſo often call'd <hi>The Son of Man</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> And that their <hi>Light within,</hi> cou'd in no Senſe, according to their Notion of it, be call'd the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> ſeeing they believe it to be <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> from <hi>Everlaſting:</hi> The <hi>Quaker</hi> Anſwered very Gravely, <hi>Ah Friend, ther is much in thoſe words. Mind, mind them!</hi> then Pointing upwards to the <hi>Sun,</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Sun of Man,</hi> that is, The <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> or the <hi>Light</hi> in <hi>Man.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was ſolv'd!</p>
                  <p>Another of their <hi>Preachers, Holding forth</hi> in a <hi>Publick Meeting,</hi> (I can Produce witneſſes) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating that <hi>Text</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> iv. 17. <hi>We ſhall be Caught up in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air,</hi> did thus <hi>Learnedly</hi> Expound, <hi>We muſt meet the Lord, in the</hi> Heir, <hi>that is, in the</hi> Light, <hi>which is</hi> Chriſt, <hi>who is the</hi> Heir <hi>of All things.</hi> Another ſpeaking of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>Body;</hi> And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard ſome ſay, That we ſhall then have <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi> Bodies.

                  <p>This is like what is told in <hi>Sat. Dis.</hi> p. 42, 43. of <hi>Another</hi> of their <hi>Preachers</hi> miſtaking that <hi>Text</hi> Joh. xiv. 2. <hi>In my Father's Houſe are many Manſions,</hi> where inſtead of <hi>Manſions</hi> he cry'd
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95758:144"/>
                     <hi>Manchets;</hi> And thence Improv'd what a <hi>Good Houſe</hi> God <hi>kept,</hi> There was Plenty of <hi>Bread,</hi> many <hi>Manchets!</hi> And <hi>Another</hi> Applying that Text <hi>Matth.</hi> xi. 30. <hi>My yoke is Eaſie, and my Burden is Light,</hi> to the <hi>Light</hi> within.</p>
                  <p>I cou'd Multiply upon ſuch <hi>Fooleries</hi> of the <hi>Quaker-Infallibility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you muſt Excuſe ſuch <hi>Blunders</hi> in their <hi>Learned Clerks:</hi> for many of them Learn by the <hi>Ear,</hi> and not by the <hi>Eye;</hi> They cannot <hi>Read,</hi> And ſo know not the Difference of words which <hi>ſound</hi> alike, as <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Sun, Air</hi> and <hi>Heir</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This is one of the Reaſons that they Play with Us at <hi>Croſs-Purpoſes,</hi> and is one of their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Methods</hi> in <hi>Anſwering</hi> what is <hi>Wrote</hi> againſt them.<note place="margin">Not to take an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. Another Method they have in <hi>Anſwering,</hi> is, never to take an <hi>Anſwer.</hi> But to Inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame thing over and over again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any Notice of the <hi>Anſwers</hi> that are Made to them, of which ſome Inſtances are given above.</p>
                  <p>And then, on the other hand, if they Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh any thing which they call an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to ſuch a Book; if any thing in that Book, tho' not touch'd at all in the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> ſhou'd after be objected, they Cry, that is <hi>Anſwer'd</hi> already, <hi>Confuted, overthrown</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus in this <hi>Appendix</hi> p. 10. the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay no more to all thoſe ſeveral <hi>Charges</hi> which are laid againſt them in the <hi>Sn.</hi> And, to ſave Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, Referr'd to in <hi>Primitive Hereſie,</hi> but, <hi>That theſe Charges are, near All of them, already Anſwered by</hi> George Whitehead <hi>in the Antidote.</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:95758:144"/>This was ſpoke a little Guiltily. <hi>Near All of them.</hi> That confeſſes ther were <hi>Some</hi> not <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd.</hi> If you mean a <hi>Fair</hi> and <hi>Full Anſwer,</hi> then the truth is, not <hi>one</hi> of them is <hi>Anſwer'd.</hi> But ther are a <hi>Great Many,</hi> and not <hi>Near All</hi> that are not ſo much as once <hi>Mention'd,</hi> or the leaſt <hi>Notice</hi> taken of them in that <hi>Antidote;</hi> and theſe of the Greateſt Conſequence, yet this muſt ſerve for an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to them <hi>All!</hi> And to afford this <hi>Appendix</hi> to ſay, in the ſame place, That <hi>His Abuſes and Falſities are therein lay'd at his Door.</hi> Yet is ther not one <hi>Abuſe</hi> or one <hi>Falſity</hi> in the <hi>Sn.</hi> made appear in either the <hi>Antidote</hi> or this <hi>Appendix.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus that Author's <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> concerning <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is ſerv'd.

Yet this paſſes among the <hi>Quakers</hi> as a Full <hi>Confutation.</hi> And when I have urg'd ſomething out of this Book to ſome of them, they have ſaid, O that is <hi>Anſwer'd,</hi> tho' not one word of it in this <hi>Some Notice</hi> of <hi>Whitehead</hi>'s.

                     <hi>Will.

And one wou'd think this a very Material Point, for the <hi>Quakers</hi> to Juſtifie their <hi>Seperation.</hi> The <hi>Appendix</hi> concludes with a <hi>Reply</hi> to this. Which I will ſet down Every word, to ſave the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Pains of going thither for it. Thus then it follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He now Numbers up in Page</hi> 30, 31, 32. <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things, wherein he wou'd fain have the Church and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s agree, they not being ſufficient (as he ſays) for Seperation. This Man is of a very Changeable Humor, in his Title, and for near all the Book, we are ſad Hereticks, but now he wou'd have us Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, which if we will not be, he gives us a Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Advertiſement, that he will Trump up more Hereſies upon us. Well, in that let him do as God ſhall permit; But of two things he may be aſſured, that we ſhall have no Communion with his Lies, nor he true Peace in Perſiſting in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Appendix</hi> ends. And ther is not one <hi>Syllable</hi> more in Defence of all the Alledg'd Cauſes of their <hi>Seperation.</hi> Yet this is call'd an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>Primitive Hereſie;</hi> And it comes in but by the By as an <hi>Appendix</hi> to <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote.</hi> So now that Book <hi>Prim. Heres.</hi> is <hi>Anſwer'd</hi> too! And if you ſhou'd urge any of the Anſwers there given to the <hi>Cauſes</hi> which the <hi>Quakers</hi> Pretend to Juſtifie their <hi>Seperation</hi> and <hi>Schiſm</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:95758:145"/>from the whole <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> They wou'd ſay, O that Book of <hi>Prim.

                     </note>6. I muſt come to another Egregious <hi>Trick</hi> which they uſe; when <hi>Quotations</hi> are brought out of their Books ſo Expreſs and Full that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be <hi>Anſwer'd</hi> to them, then they look and ſee if ther be nothing elſe ſpoke of in the Place Quoted, beſides that which is brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: of which they can ſeldom miſs in their own Writings, which are all <hi>Confus'd</hi> and <hi>Huddl'd,</hi> a hundred things together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Tail.</hi> And then if the <hi>Objector</hi> brings only that which is Proper to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he is upon, as he ought to do, to avoid Confuſion, they Cry out that they are falſly <hi>Quoted.</hi> Why? becauſe <hi>(forſooth)</hi> the whole is not Quoted, tho' All be Quoted that is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the Subject; which is all that ought to be Quoted, and more wou'd be a Fault.</p>
                  <p>Thus in <hi>Prim. Heres.</hi> p. 10. where the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was the <hi>Quakers</hi> Contempt of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> a <hi>Quotation</hi> is brought out of <hi>Edw. Burrough</hi>'s works p. 190, 191. where he Reckons up ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things as <hi>Damnable Hereſies,</hi> ſuch as calling the <hi>Steeple-Houſe</hi> a <hi>Church,</hi> ſaying that <hi>Singing</hi> David's <hi>Experiences</hi> in <hi>Metre,</hi> was ſinging to the <hi>Praiſe</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and other like <hi>Perilous</hi> things!

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95758:146"/>Hereſies,</hi> but ſays that to ſay <hi>Sprinkling In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants with Water— is Baptiſm into the Faith of Chriſt, this is the Doctrin of the Devil.</hi> And this is thus Quoted in <hi>Prim. Heres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what ſays the <hi>Appendix</hi> to this? Do's it Deny the <hi>Quotation,</hi> or any word of it? No. What then? it ſays p. 33. That ther are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things left out. That is true. For they did not belong to the preſent Subject, which was <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> But is not all that is ſaid of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> in that Quotation? And is it not Nam'd there among the <hi>Damnable Hereſies?</hi> And is it not ſaid of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> particularly, i. e. the <hi>Sprinkling</hi> of Infants, and calling it a <hi>Baptiſm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Faith of Chriſt,</hi> that <hi>This is the Doctrin of the Devil?</hi> Yea. None of all this is Deny'd. What objection then can be made, that other things, which were not the Subject in hand, ſhou'd be left out; And which wou'd have Confus'd the Subject more, if they had been in? You ſhall ſee. <hi>Appendix</hi> ſays That <hi>as the words lie in the Charge, they are not like</hi> E. B<hi>'s. words.</hi> Why, are they not his very <hi>Words?</hi> Yea.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95758:148"/>moderation towards the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> in his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote.</hi> p. 114. where he ſays, That they do not <hi>Cenſure</hi> or <hi>Condemn</hi> thoſe who are <hi>Conſcientiouſly Tender in the obſervation thereof, for Practiſing that which they believe is their Duty, either in Breaking of Bread, or Water Baptiſm.</hi> To this ſays <hi>Appen.</hi> p. 34. That <hi>G. W.</hi>'s words are <hi>Imperfectly Quoted,</hi> and <hi>neither Fully nor Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given.</hi> Not <hi>Fully?</hi> Why? <hi>Appen.</hi> Sets down there half a Page more of what follows theſe words, which is a Running out upon their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Baptiſm.</hi> And what is this to the buſineſs? That <hi>Author</hi> had a mind to ſhew only what Allowances the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Now make, on their behalf who <hi>Conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi> Partake of the <hi>Outward</hi> or <hi>Water-Baptiſm.</hi> And his <hi>Quotation</hi> was <hi>Full,</hi> as to that. But why was not this Quotation <hi>Truly</hi> given? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not <hi>Fully,</hi> for the Reaſon above. Thus that <hi>Quotation</hi> is laid aſide! And not without Great <hi>Vaunting</hi> of their having Diſcover'd the <hi>Certain knowledge of thy Baſeneſs</hi> (ſay they to the Author) <hi>from thy Maiming of this Place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But they had Reaſon to be Concern'd at this <hi>Quotation,</hi> ſince they had not <hi>Sincerity</hi> enough to own the <hi>Truth.</hi> For their Great buſineſs at Preſent is to Perſuade the world, That they have never <hi>Alter'd</hi> or <hi>Chang'd</hi> their <hi>Principles</hi> ſince they were firſt a People. Becauſe they ſet up firſt upon the <hi>Infallible</hi> Guidance of the Holy <hi>Spirit;</hi> and that Every thing they ſpoke was the <hi>Immediate</hi> Dictate of the Holy <hi>Ghoſt;</hi> and they ſtand upon the ſame to this Day. Now <hi>Changing</hi> and <hi>Contradicting</hi> will not Fadge with
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95758:149"/>this. Therefore this <hi>Appen.</hi> Labours mainly to Prove that they never have <hi>Chang'd,</hi> as p. 6. <hi>Our Principles are now no other than what they were, when we were firſt a People, for Truth Changes not.</hi> And p. 53. <hi>I have before ſhewed, that our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are now no other than what they were when firſt a People.</hi> And <hi>Preface</hi> p. 3. <hi>What we now Profeſs, is no other than what we did.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This has been Diſ-prov'd in a great Many Inſtances. But let us try one more in this <hi>Quotation,</hi> with which they are ſo <hi>Angry;</hi> and then you will ſee the Reaſon of their <hi>Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> Is this <hi>Moderation</hi> which <hi>G. W.</hi> has now, at laſt, put on towards the Holy <hi>Sacraments,</hi> no other than what they Profeſs'd from the Beginning? How then came they to <hi>Excomunicate</hi> any for Receiving of <hi>Baptiſm?</hi> as for Inſtance, <hi>John Cox.</hi> And call'd it, a Drawing back to the <hi>Weak</hi> and <hi>Beggarly Elements.</hi> Come, <hi>Friends,</hi> ſpeak out in <hi>Plaineſs,</hi> and tell Us, wou'd you own any for a True <hi>Quaker</hi> who ſhou'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and frequent the Holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> of The <hi>Lord's Supper?</hi> wou'd you neither <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> not <hi>Condemn</hi> them, if they made a <hi>Conſcience</hi> of it, as their <hi>Duty?</hi> Wou'd you have Greater <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> towards theſe than for <hi>William Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> whoſe <hi>Excommunication</hi> is put in the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,</hi> at the End of this, for <hi>Marrying</hi> one that was not a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and for <hi>Marrying</hi> by a <hi>Prieſt?</hi> Was this a greater offence than the Receiving of the <hi>outward Baptiſm?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, in good Earneſt, did you never <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> or <hi>Condemn</hi> Baptiſm? Is this new <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>G. W.'s</hi> no other than what you always did Profeſs? In the <hi>Quotation</hi> before brought
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95758:149"/>of <hi>Edw. Burrough</hi>'s, it is Rank'd amongſt the <hi>Damnable Hereſies,</hi> even to the <hi>Denying</hi> the <hi>Lord who bought <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> And it is call'd, <hi>The Doctrin of the Devil.</hi> And p. 644. of his <hi>Works</hi> he ſays, <hi>That it is not Lawful for the Saints of God, to Join themſelves to your Ordinances.</hi> Yet now <hi>G. W.</hi> will let them go, and neither <hi>Cenſure</hi> nor <hi>Condemn</hi> them. He has forgot a Book of his own, to which he gave this <hi>Title. The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the true Miniſtry, in Baptizing with the Spirit; And the</hi> Idolatry <hi>of ſuch men as are Doting about ſhadows and Carnal Ordinances, and their Ignorance of the Spirits Baptiſm (of which water-Baptiſm was but a Figure) Diſcover'd. And herein is ſhewed, that Water-Baptiſm is neither of Neceſſity to Salvation, nor yet is now Practiſed either by Authority from Heaven, or by any New-Teſtament Law that is in force upon Believers; ſeeing the Subſtance and the End of things Aboliſhed is come and Enjoyed, wherein the Types Shadows and Figures are Ended.</hi> Yet <hi>George</hi> now will neither <hi>Cenſure</hi> nor <hi>Condemn</hi> them if they be <hi>Conſcientiouſly Tender in the Obſervation</hi> of theſe <hi>Aboliſhed Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows,</hi> tho' he calls it <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> nay and <hi>Doting Idolatry!</hi> yet theſe men never <hi>Vary'd!</hi> they always ſaid the ſame, <hi>ſince they were firſt a People, that they ſay now!</hi>

And coming to this Head, p. 31. they call this <hi>Poſition</hi> (as truly it is) <hi>Blaſphemy. G. Fox,</hi> Anſwers, to this, in his <hi>Gr. Myſt.</hi> p. 227. and ſets down this as the firſt of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> Principles, <hi>That the Soul is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95758:156"/>a Part of the Divine Eſſence.</hi> And thence Inferrs, p. 229. That in calling this <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> they had given Judgment againſt themſelves. <hi>And ſo you five</hi> (ſays he) <hi>have Judged your ſelves to be Blaſphemers, who ſaid the Soul was Part of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence, and yet 'tis Blaſphemy to ſay ſo.</hi> This is <hi>Giving that for a man's Anſwer, which is not,</hi> with a witneſs! And if <hi>Will. Penn</hi> can any Longer Defend <hi>G. Fox</hi> (even <hi>Dear George,</hi> who <hi>Excelleth All the Quakers</hi>) to be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> by his own Rule, he will Exceed himſelf; and <hi>Out-do,</hi> all that he has Ever yet <hi>Done!</hi> At leaſt, I hope he will Alter his Opinion, if he ſpoke it ſincerely, <hi>That <hi>George Fox,</hi> was as Good a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Aſaiah,</hi>
                     </hi> which has been Mention'd before.</p>
                  <p>But not only Putting words upon a Man, which he did not ſay, nay Quite Contrary to what he ſays; but Leaving out the <hi>Material</hi> part of a Man's <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and giving that for his <hi>Anſwer,</hi> is <hi>Belying</hi> of a Man, and comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Will.

Let me give one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this (among many that I cou'd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce) <hi>Matthew Caffyn,</hi> in his <hi>Damnable Hereſies of the Quakers Discover'd.</hi> p. 29. gives his <hi>Charge</hi> thus. <hi>The Quaker ſaith, that Chriſt is already Come the ſecond time: And</hi> George Fox <hi>Affirmed in Plain words, before many Witneſſes, that he knew him come within him, and he looked for Him to come NO OTHERWISE: And</hi> James Parnal <hi>affirmeth</hi>— <hi>That by Preaching of a</hi> Chriſt <hi>in</hi> Heaven, <hi>the Devil gets his work done on Earth, as appears in his Book call'd</hi> Satan's Deſign diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd. p. 19. 25.</p>

He Denies not the <hi>Quotation.</hi> But ſays nothing to it. Then as to what is Charg'd upon Himſelf, he Quotes the <hi>Page</hi> in <hi>Caffyn,</hi> but Repeats his words thus. <hi>And</hi> George Fox <hi>ſaid, that he knew Chriſt come in him.</hi> p. 29. Then he Crys, that <hi>Chriſt is in you, except ye be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.</hi> As if <hi>Caffyn</hi> had Deny'd the <hi>Inward Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the <hi>Influence</hi> of His H. <hi>Spirit,</hi> in the <hi>Hearts</hi> of <hi>Believers,</hi> which no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did Deny. But they Deny the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> His <hi>Fleſh, Blood,</hi> and <hi>Bones,</hi> in <hi>Men,</hi> as the <hi>Quakers</hi> Blaſpheme. And <hi>Caffyn</hi> found no Fault with <hi>Fox</hi>'s ſaying, that <hi>He knew Chriſt come within him.</hi> On the Contrary, he Juſtifies the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by His <hi>Spirit.</hi> But he laid the ſtreſs upon <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>That he Looked upon</hi> Chriſt <hi>to come NO OTHERWISE,</hi> whith was put in <hi>Capital</hi> Letters, to ſhew that the ſtreſs lay upon that, as being a Denyal of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Second <hi>Coming,</hi> to the <hi>Final Judgment.</hi> Of all which <hi>G. Fox</hi> took no Notice at all, but gives his words ſhort, as above Quoted. Whereby it appears (which I have often obſerv'd before) That without looking into the Books which this <hi>Fox</hi> Anſwers, ther is no knowing of their Meaning, or what they <hi>object,</hi> by his <hi>Falſe</hi> and often <hi>Abſurd</hi> Chopping and Changing of their Words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caffyn</hi> ibid. p. 35.

This, as before told, is, the <hi>Body, Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Bones</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which they ſuppoſe He had from <hi>Eternity;</hi> and which now Dwells in the <hi>Quakers,</hi> not the <hi>Fleſh</hi> of <hi>our Nature,</hi> which <hi>Jeſus</hi> aſſum'd in the <hi>Womb</hi> of the Bleſſed <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</hi> That is not the <hi>Fleſh</hi> which we <hi>Eat</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>And the rather, becauſe this very <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is Particularly Inſiſted upon in <hi>Prim.

                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:95758:173"/>Well, but the <hi>whole Body</hi> of the <hi>Quakers</hi> are brought in upon this Point, ſo far, as that the <hi>Principle</hi> upon which theſe <hi>New-Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> go, is the avowed <hi>Principle</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Quakers. viz.</hi> of taking the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> in an <hi>Inward Senſe,</hi> to Mean only the <hi>Riſing</hi> up of the <hi>Light</hi> in their <hi>Hearts;</hi> and upon this Account, they Deny the Literal <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> which has been ſufficiently ſhewn. They ſay, that thoſe who obey the <hi>Light</hi> have obtain'd the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> already: And, in this Senſe, They call themſelves <hi>The Children of the Reſurrection,</hi> in Oppoſition to <hi>The Children of this World,</hi> by which Name the <hi>Wicked,</hi> are Deſcrib'd. Now the <hi>New-Quakers</hi> finding it <hi>Written,</hi> That <hi>the Children of this World do Marry:</hi> But that <hi>The Children of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neither Marry nor are Given in Marriage;</hi> conſequently they finding <hi>Marriage</hi> Inconſiſtant with the <hi>Reſurrection-ſtate:</hi> and thinking, by the Receiv'd <hi>Principle</hi> of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they were come to the <hi>Reſurrection-ſtate,</hi> it follow'd, of Courſe, That they muſt turn off their <hi>Wives.</hi> But then, finding likewiſe, That theſe their <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection-Bodys</hi> Retain'd ſtill a ſtrange <hi>Hankering</hi> after the Old way of the <hi>Fleſh;</hi> And that <hi>Propagation</hi> was ſtill to be kept up, they cou'd Fall no where elſe, but upon <hi>Fornication.</hi> For, <hi>The Children of this World</hi> MARRY! And indeed this is a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Conſequence of the <hi>Quaker-Notion</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> and were Enough to Cure them (any Sober man wou'd think) of this <hi>Mad</hi> and <hi>Heritical</hi> Extravagance. But they ſtill ſtick to it. For <hi>Infallibility</hi> muſt never <hi>Repent</hi> or <hi>Amend!</hi> Upon this occaſion, they are Ask'd
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95758:173"/>in <hi>Prim.

Charles <hi>Art thou a</hi> Child of wrath? <hi>He muſt Anſwer</hi> Yea; <hi>or go againſt his own avowed Principles.</hi> Muſt he ſo? But what if he ſhou'd not? than BAYS<hi>'s Suppoſe</hi> is ſpoyl'd. But if he ſhou'd not, then he muſt <hi>Go againſt his own Avowed Principles.</hi> What <hi>Principles</hi> are theſe? they Name none. They leave us to Gueſs. And I think I have found it out. It is ſaid in our <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> That we are <hi>By Nature Born in Sin, and the Children of Wrath.</hi> There it is! And now they <hi>Twit</hi> us again with our Confeſſing our ſelves to be <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> And <hi>Hugg</hi> themſelves in their <hi>Perfection!</hi> But <hi>Hark ye,</hi> my <hi>Friends,</hi> you have Read but Half. For it is ſaid, That <hi>being by Nature
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95758:174"/>Born in Sin, and the Children of Wrath, we are Hereby</hi> (that is, by coming, as we ought, to <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Holy <hi>Baptiſm</hi>) <hi>made the Children of Grace.</hi> So that, by our own Principles, we are <hi>Children of Grace;</hi> and <hi>you</hi> are <hi>The Children of Wrath,</hi> who Remain in your <hi>Natural Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and <hi>Flout</hi> at, and <hi>Deſpiſe</hi> thoſe <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> has Commanded. And therefore your <hi>Genteel</hi> Inference, upon your Forcing <hi>Charles</hi> to ſay <hi>Yea,</hi> whether he will or not, That <hi>it is very Hard, a Man ſhou'd ſend Himſelf thus to Hell,</hi> muſt be ſent Home again to be Anſwer'd at <hi>The Second-Days Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> And <hi>Charles</hi> has Eſcap'd for Once! <hi>But don't wonder</hi> (ſays <hi>Appen.</hi>) <hi>till we ſee what the next Queſtion will do.</hi> Well, we won't if we can Help it. Now <hi>Charles,</hi> look to thy ſelf! <hi>Let me ask again,</hi> Charles, <hi>art thou a Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Son? He will ſay,</hi> NAY. That is, if he be not <hi>Croſs!</hi> And becauſe we know he is a <hi>Sinner,</hi> he may, perhaps, not Clear himſelf from all Breaches even of the <hi>Fifth Command.</hi> But he ſhall not put thoſe Tricks upon Us. He ſhall Anſwer <hi>Nay,</hi> as you wou'd have him. And now what is your Inference? Be ſure you hold him Faſt. Why then, ſay you, <hi>It is written,</hi> Diſobedience is as the Sin of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft: <hi>therefore ſay all Good Men, Diſobedience is a wicked thing, and conſequently of the Devil.</hi> Verily thoſe <hi>Good Men</hi> are very <hi>Ingenious</hi> men, who have found it out, That <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft</hi> is a <hi>wicked thing!</hi> And more than that, That it is <hi>Conſequently</hi> of the <hi>Devil!</hi> Well, what of all this? <hi>Now Reader</hi> (ſays <hi>Appen</hi>) <hi>ſee, Before he ſent himſelf, and now he wou'd Hale
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95758:174"/>all the People thither.</hi> Whither? To the <hi>Devil!</hi> That's Hard indeed. But <hi>(Appen.)</hi> you have Forgot that you made him Anſwer <hi>Nay,</hi> to this Queſtion of <hi>Diſobedience.</hi> And then, How do's this Affect him? No matter for that. It affects others. For (ſays <hi>Appen.</hi>) he calls thoſe <hi>Diſobedient</hi> who are truly <hi>Obedient</hi> and <hi>Loyal:</hi> And ſo wou'd Hale <hi>All the People</hi> to the <hi>Devil.</hi> Do's he then call <hi>All</hi> the People <hi>Diſobedient?</hi> Do's he Except <hi>None?</hi> This is a Terrible Fellow! we muſt look to him!</p>
                  <p>But now <hi>Appen.</hi> ſuppoſe he ſhou'd call for <hi>Proof</hi> of this? Have you your <hi>Witneſſeſs</hi> Ready? (For you muſt not Expect the <hi>Rogue</hi> will <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs!</hi>) Otherwiſe may he call <hi>Thee</hi> and thy <hi>Friends,</hi> who thus Accuſe him, as you have done to others, upon Leſs occaſion, <hi>Lyars, Impoſtors, Cheats</hi> &amp;c.</p>

They tell you of their manner of <hi>Marrying</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> what <hi>Caution,</hi> &amp;c. they uſe in it. But what is all this to the buſineſs? Do they tell how to Reconcile this with that <hi>Text,</hi> that the <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> do not <hi>Marry?</hi> No. Not a word! They Forgot that <hi>Text.</hi> Why was that objected to them? Had they any thing to do to Anſwer that <hi>Text?</hi> ſo one wou'd have thought! for this <hi>Text</hi> was the whole objection, as being that, which Perſuaded the <hi>New Quakers</hi> to throw off <hi>Marriage.</hi> And they Anſwer it Cloſely (as they ſay) without ſo much as Naming of it, or taking the leaſt notice, that ever it had been objected. This is their way! And thus they can Anſwer any Argument in the world, that is, by never Heeding it; but bringing in ſome long Diſcourſe of other matters, till you <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get</hi> it: And then, if you <hi>Remember</hi> it no more, it is Fully <hi>Anſwered!</hi>

They call for more, while they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to Repent. And (tho' it be needleſs) I will Gratify them, or the Reader, with one more that is Remarkable. The <hi>Great</hi> Quaker <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of <hi>Mary-Land,</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> was <hi>Thomas Thurſton,</hi> who, while the Deputy Governor was abſent a year or more in <hi>England,</hi> came with a <hi>Meſſage</hi> from the <hi>Lord</hi> (as he <hi>Horridly</hi> pretended!) to his <hi>Wife,</hi> who was a <hi>Quaker,</hi> that he was ſent to Propagate the Holy ſeed with her. And when her Husband Return'd, finding a Child more than he had left, ſhe Confeſs'd the whole matter. Upon which he oblig'd her to go to the <hi>Quaker-Meeting,</hi> and there <hi>Publickly</hi> to Declare the whole Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous <hi>Truth,</hi> which ſhe did. Nor cou'd <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Deny it. Upon which he came to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and, till it was otherwiſe Diſcover'd, was Receiv'd by the <hi>Friends,</hi> and <hi>Preach'd</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, as Formerly. As he did in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Land,</hi> for ſometime after it was Publickly known there. And his <hi>Light within</hi> was thought ſo <hi>Infallible,</hi> that another <hi>Quaker-Preacher</hi> own'd
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:95758:178"/>it to him (of Good Credit) who told it to me, That the Generality of the <hi>Quakers</hi> there, nay, ſaid he, I my ſelf Durſt not Judge him, even in our minds, not to have had an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration</hi> from <hi>God</hi> for what he did.

                  <p>This was the Argument by which <hi>G.

And how by him the Hearts of others were and may be Judged by the Spirit of Truth; and alſo how things by the Spiritual Man were Judged of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning both Salvation and Dammation,</hi> &amp;c.

And it is ſubſcrib'd <hi>George Fox.</hi> There he ſpeaks of himſelf in the third Perſon, and ſays, <hi>GEORGE FOX coming to</hi> Drayton, <hi>to

Becauſe of the mighty <hi>Miracle</hi> he ſhewed that <hi>Day,</hi> in <hi>Judging</hi> the <hi>Heart</hi> of <hi>Nat.

He might have a Good, and he might have a Bad. Then</hi> George <hi>told him, Here thou hast Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted thy ſelf to be no Miniſter of God, but a Falſe Miniſter. For the Ministers of Christ and the New Covenant of God, they cou'd Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Spirits and Try them.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. <hi>And as you may Read in</hi> Iſaiah, <hi>he Diſcern'd the</hi> Familier <hi>Spirit, and Judged it.</hi> Iſa. 8. <hi>And the</hi> Apoſtle <hi>Diſcerned the</hi> Witch-Craft <hi>of the</hi> Witches <hi>that had</hi> Bewitched <hi>the</hi> Galatians, <hi>read</hi> Gal. 3. <hi>And here thou haſt Manifeſted thy ſelf to be a Blind Guide, who can put no Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Precious and the vile, who hast no Salt to ſavour withall, therefore thou art good for nothing but to be Caſt out, and Troden under

Through all which Book this Argument is carry'd on, That he can be no true <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> who cannot <hi>Diſcern</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> the <hi>Hearts</hi> of other men.

And that the <hi>Light</hi> within <hi>Them,</hi> is not only a <hi>Ray</hi> or <hi>Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but is <hi>Chriſt Himſelf</hi> in <hi>Perſon.</hi> And therefore <hi>Appen.</hi> do's ſo often tell Us, not only of Believing, That ther is ſuch a <hi>Light</hi> in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> But to <hi>Believe</hi> In <hi>That Light.</hi> viz.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95758:183"/>
                     <hi>Prim. Heres.</hi> This <hi>Charge</hi> is there <hi>Sect.</hi> vii. p. 17.

                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:95758:183"/>Well, but notwithſtanding of all theſe <hi>Proofs,</hi> here is no <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the Caſe!

                     <hi>Both of which are ſhewn, not to be Merely want of</hi> Manners; <hi>But a Form'd</hi> Deſign <hi>to Subvert</hi> Government, <hi>when it is in Any other Hands but their Own.

                  <p>I Come now to Sect. vii. of <hi>Prim. Heres.</hi> And to Examin the Anſwers given to it by <hi>Appen.</hi> The ſubject is, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>ſtiffneſs in not taking off their</hi> Hats, <hi>and Giving men their</hi> Civil <hi>Titles.</hi> Of which we juſt now ſpoke <hi>Obiter.</hi> But we will Examin their <hi>Anſwers</hi> more thoroly. They begin in <hi>Appen.</hi> p. 48. And firſt, this is call'd a <hi>Ridiculous Charge.</hi> And ſo indeed it is, in this Senſe, as it is a <hi>Charge</hi> of a moſt <hi>Ridiculous Whim,</hi> if it were no worſe: for it is not only a <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Senſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Singularity,</hi> but it is a <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and Diſſolution of <hi>Order,</hi> and the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Relations</hi> that men bare to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which <hi>God</hi> Ordain'd, and without which the world cou'd not Subſiſt. And therefore it is brought in <hi>Prim. Heres.</hi> Next to <hi>Sect.</hi> vi. which treats of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Contempt of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> as a Plain <hi>Inſtance</hi> of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:95758:184"/>it. To this ſays <hi>Appen.</hi> in their <hi>Courtly</hi> way, <hi>He Falſly and Fooliſhly Inſinuates this</hi> (that is, taking off our <hi>Hats,</hi> and Giving men their <hi>Civil</hi> Titles) <hi>to have been Commanded by the Apoſtles</hi> &amp;c. They mean, That ther is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in <hi>Scripture</hi> for taking off ones <hi>Hat.</hi> That is, Literally a <hi>Hat.</hi> They wou'd have the word <hi>Hat</hi> nam'd. And here they are Pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Secure, for ther were no <hi>Hats</hi> worn in thoſe Days, nor many Ages after. But ſurely theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> are not ſo Dull, as not to know, That it is the <hi>Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> which is Due to our <hi>Superiors</hi> that is here Treated of, tho' the <hi>Manner</hi> of Expreſſing it may Differ, according to the Cuſtom of Several Countrys. Thus <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-covering</hi> of the <hi>Head</hi> is not us'd as a <hi>mark</hi> of <hi>Reſpect</hi> in <hi>Turkey.</hi> Therefore they do it not there, even in Preſence of the <hi>Grand Segnior.</hi> There the <hi>Quakers</hi> may have this <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> But if they wou'd obſerve the <hi>Scripture</hi> Literally (as they Pretend) they ſhou'd put off their <hi>Shoos,</hi> inſtead of their <hi>Hats.</hi> For that was then the Token of <hi>Reſpect;</hi> thus <hi>Moſes</hi> was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to put off his <hi>Shoos,</hi> when he Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch'd to the <hi>Buſh,</hi> not to take off his <hi>Hat.</hi> Now, if the <hi>Quakers</hi> wou'd have <hi>Texts</hi> for ſhewing <hi>Reſpect</hi> to <hi>Superiors;</hi> they may have Abundance. <hi>Honour to whom Honour is Due.</hi> &amp;c. And if Taking off ones <hi>Hat</hi> be us'd as a mark of Paying <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Reſpect,</hi> then it is Included in this Command. And the not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, is an Expreſs <hi>Breach</hi> of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. And it is not in our Power to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point what ſhall be the <hi>Manner</hi> of Paying <hi>Honour:</hi> we muſt Submit, in that, to the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:95758:185"/>of the <hi>Country</hi> where we Live. You find frequent Inſtances in <hi>Scripture</hi> of Falling <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> to <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Worſhiping</hi> of them with our <hi>Faces</hi> bent down to the <hi>Earth;</hi> and not only to <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>wicked Kings,</hi> but to <hi>David,</hi> and the Beſt of them. None came into their Preſence, without Paying of this <hi>Honour</hi> to them. And this was a Great Deal more, than Bare Taking off ones <hi>Hat.</hi> We never find, That either <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelf, or His <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Refus'd to Give all the <hi>Reſpect</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles that were Cuſtomarily Paid even to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Magiſtrates.</hi> He acknowleg'd to <hi>Pilat,</hi> that his <hi>Power</hi> was from <hi>Above.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave <hi>Felix</hi> the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Moſt Noble,</hi> Even when <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> call'd him <hi>Mad:</hi> and Ask'd Pardon for ſpeaking <hi>Diſ-Reſpectfully</hi> to the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> tho' Judging him, <hi>Contrary</hi> to the <hi>Law.</hi> A <hi>Quaker</hi> wou'd have call'd him (if he Durſt) a <hi>Chemarim, Baal</hi>'s <hi>Prieſt, Serpent, Dog, Devil,</hi> as they have call'd our <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> when they were out of their fingers.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95758:185"/>who did it, Guilty of as much <hi>Ill-Manners,</hi> as a <hi>Quaker.</hi> But if they ſet up ſuch <hi>Dis-Reſpect</hi> as a <hi>Principle,</hi> and made Themſelves <hi>Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed</hi> by it; I ſhou'd Condemn it, even as a <hi>Hereſie:</hi> for ſuch I think it, to Diſſolve the Good <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and ſet <hi>Mankind</hi> Looſe from the <hi>Diſtance</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors;</hi> and to Teach this, as a <hi>Doctrin</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>However, againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> this holds good, by their own <hi>Principles,</hi> if it be any <hi>Sin</hi> (which has been fully Prov'd) to be not only <hi>Hereſie,</hi> but even a <hi>Denying of the Lord who Bought them.</hi> For thus ſay they in <hi>Truth defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Quakers,</hi> which is ſaid in the <hi>Title Page,</hi> to be <hi>Written from the Spirit of Truth in</hi> George Whitehead <hi>and</hi> George Fox <hi>the Younger.</hi> p. 39. 40. <hi>All Hereticks are ſubverted and do ſin, and in Sinning, they Deny the Lord that bought them; for Every Sin is a Transgreſſion of the Law: And whatever ſin they Commit againſt Chriſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they Deny him.</hi> Here we ſee the Neceſſity of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Sinleſs <hi>Perfection!</hi> For they make <hi>Every Sin</hi> to be a <hi>Denying of the Lord that bought them.</hi> And conſequently to be not only <hi>Hereſie</hi> but <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and <hi>Renouncing</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> Whereby they have, by their own Confeſſion, <hi>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95758:186"/>your <hi>Hats,</hi> becauſe <hi>(Forſooth)</hi> you wou'd not be the <hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> (we Believe you) you Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act that ſame <hi>Reſpect</hi> from your own <hi>Servants,</hi> and make them take off their <hi>Hats</hi> to <hi>You.</hi> Nay not only your <hi>Menial Servants,</hi> but your <hi>Apprentices,</hi> as ſeen every Day in <hi>London.</hi> Now, do you think theſe to be more <hi>Servants</hi> to <hi>you,</hi> and to owe <hi>you</hi> more <hi>Duty,</hi> than you owe to the <hi>King,</hi> or any <hi>Human Governor?</hi> Yes. You do think ſo; and (as <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and his <hi>Galileans</hi>) that you ought not to be <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> to any <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Government,</hi> but your own <hi>Jeſus;</hi> in whoſe Right, you think that you have the <hi>Heirſhip</hi> of the whole <hi>Earth:</hi> and Juſt Power to <hi>Fight</hi> for it too, as you have ſet forth in your <hi>Printed Declaration,</hi> which you have been ſo often told of, but will Give no Anſwer to it.

                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:95758:186"/>No, this will not do. You <hi>Refuſe</hi> it, becauſe it is a Token of <hi>Reſpect,</hi> and for no other Reaſon. As <hi>Francis Howgil</hi> (a <hi>Quaker Pillar</hi>) ſaid to Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> before whom he was brought; who told him, he did not value his taking off his <hi>Hat</hi> to him, but ther was a <hi>Reſpect</hi> due to <hi>Magiſtracy. Howgil</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, That <hi>God had not Commanded him to take off his Hat, and that he did not owe him that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, nor wou'd he give it him.</hi> Whereupon one that ſtood by, took off his <hi>Hat,</hi> and laid it upon the Table by him. But <hi>Howgil</hi> took it up again, and put it on. Another took it off again, and laid it on the Fire, but within his Reach. Yet <hi>Howgil</hi> wou'd not ſtoop to take it off the <hi>Fire,</hi> for if it had been <hi>Burn'd,</hi> ther had been <hi>Perſecution:</hi> and this <hi>Hat</hi> wou'd have been put into the <hi>Regiſter</hi> of the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of <hi>Friends,</hi> with the <hi>Childrens Clouts,</hi> and <hi>Hundreds</hi> of <hi>Pins,</hi> &amp;c. which are there carefully In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted! But <hi>Howgil</hi> had not that Pleaſure; for ſome body took his <hi>Hat</hi> off the <hi>Fire,</hi> before any Harm came to it, and gave it him; which on he clapt again, and wou'd not be Controul'd. This, and other Paſſages, you will find in the <hi>Irreligion of the Northern Quakers</hi> Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 1653. p. 67.68. But Inſtances of this kind are ſo Frequent, that we need not make <hi>Quotations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to ſhew further, how much they think the taking off of the <hi>Hat</hi> to be a Token of <hi>Reſpect,</hi> ther was a <hi>Civil-War</hi> among them, and ſeveral Books wrote upon it, of taking off the <hi>Hat</hi> at <hi>Prayer.</hi> Upon occaſion of which, <hi>Will.

                     <hi>God.</hi> True. But ſtill it ſhews, what they think of taking off the <hi>Hat,</hi> that it is a Token of <hi>Reſpect.</hi> And this is the Reaſon why they will not Give it to any of the <hi>Worlds Magiſtrates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſays <hi>Appen. we Expected ſome</hi> Ancient Father <hi>to Condemn us,</hi> purſuant to the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Prim. Heres.</hi> And ther are none Nam'd in p. 17. But you were told p. 14. of the Repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Exbortations</hi> in the <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> eſpecially of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Reſpect</hi> to <hi>Magiſtrates:</hi> And that the Occaſion of this was the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of the <hi>Gaulonits,</hi> followers of <hi>Judas:</hi> who (like <hi>You</hi>) threw off the <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Reſpect</hi> due to their <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> who were not of their Religion. And what needed this be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated over again in the next Leaf, while he was treating upon the ſame Subject? That is the manner of the <hi>Quaker Writers</hi> who Like ſo well what they do Themſelves, that they are never weary of <hi>Licking</hi> their <hi>Bears;</hi> but never into Good ſhape.</p>
                  <p>But how did the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Prim.

                  <p>and when they Get ſuch a <hi>King,</hi> they will Take off their Hats to Him: and leave their <hi>Sulleneſs;</hi> which they wou'd have Paſs now, like <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Scrabling</hi> at <hi>Gath,</hi> only upon the Account of <hi>Madneſs,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>Ill-Breeding.</hi> But ther is a <hi>Snake</hi> in the <hi>Graſs</hi>—They have a further Meaning; which we ſhall know, whenever it is in their Power.</p>

                  <p>And they give a Good Reaſon for it, in their <hi>Defence of the True Church of the Quakers.</hi> p. 19. for, ſay they, <hi>None knows aright how to Govern others, but them that are themſelves Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who are Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Govern, as well as to Preach; for the Spirit

Fox,</hi> and the Original <hi>Quakers</hi> came out of the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England (Omne Malum ab Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone)</hi> thence they were very fond of the <hi>North;</hi> and apply'd to Themſelves all the <hi>Propheſies</hi> where the <hi>North</hi> was Nam'd, or not Nam'd—
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:95758:197"/>for they made the <hi>Branch</hi> and the <hi>Star of Righteouſneſs</hi> ariſe out of the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England!</hi> that is, <hi>G. Fox,</hi> whom they made the <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> did not come out of the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But <hi>Fox</hi> their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> did. I ſay this, becauſe ſome of them wou'd now pretend, as if this had not been ſpoke of <hi>Fox,</hi> but of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                     <hi>G.

Gal.</hi> iii. 16. However, in the Loweſt Senſe can be put upon it, they think Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the <hi>Heirs</hi> of all the <hi>Promiſes</hi> made to the <hi>Jews.</hi> Among which, that of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> was certainly one; And Fulfill'd in the <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> But the <hi>Quakers</hi> turn it to their <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Light within:</hi> In whoſe Right, they think, That they have a <hi>Full,</hi> and <hi>In-defeaſable Title</hi> to it. And then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, All the <hi>King</hi>'s of the World ought to come with <hi>Cap</hi> in <hi>Hand</hi> to the <hi>Quakers!</hi> And <hi>State</hi> belongs to <hi>Them!</hi> of which they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> in Refuſing to Pay <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> to any <hi>Powers</hi> upon the <hi>Earth,</hi> ſo much
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:95758:197"/>as to move a <hi>Hat</hi> to the Beſt of them! or Treat them with Leſs <hi>Familiarity</hi> or other <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi> than Plain <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou!</hi> Of which we come next to ſpeak; and of the like <hi>Fig-Leaf</hi> Excuſes they give for this, as for that of the <hi>Hat,</hi> Thereby to keep their Deſigns Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcover'd</p>

This was the Reaſon, they made, at firſt, ſuch a filthy noiſe about the <hi>Singular</hi> and <hi>Plural,</hi> they were <hi>fine</hi> Hard <hi>words!</hi> And made the <hi>Quakers</hi> look <hi>Conſiderably,</hi> in a <hi>Country Town!</hi> It was ſuch a <hi>Glorious Diſcovery,</hi> that <hi>G.

                  <p>But now, after all, ſuppoſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (theſe Nice <hi>Criticks!</hi>) ſhou'd be found Guilty of the <hi>Hereſie</hi> of <hi>Falſe-Grammar,</hi> as well as the more <hi>

Tho', as I told you before, we do not put one <hi>Number</hi> for another, but the word <hi>You</hi> is with us, both <hi>Singular</hi> and <hi>Plural,</hi> as the word <hi>Sheep</hi> (to Deſcend to your underſtanding) or (to come nearer to you) <hi>Swine.</hi> Next <hi>Review</hi> of <hi>Hereſies</hi> that you Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, let this <hi>Vulgar Error</hi> be ſet in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Rank! and write your ſelves <hi>Sheepes,</hi> or <hi>Swines,</hi> which you like beſt, or to which you are moſt Like.

The time is Coming, when Both ſhall be <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,</hi> unleſs for <hi>Deteſtation. Appen.</hi> is very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry p. 49. That <hi>G.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95758:199"/>call themſelves not by His <hi>Name,</hi> or by any other. <hi>Judas</hi>'s Followers were call'd <hi>Gaulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> or <hi>Galileans,</hi> but <hi>Fox</hi>'s, nothing at all, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they were not fit to be <hi>Nam'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why was not <hi>Judas</hi> an <hi>Original</hi> to <hi>Fox,</hi> in the Point before mention'd, of <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>Magiſtracy?</hi> No, not in the Point of the <hi>Hat,</hi> becauſe <hi>Judas</hi> wore no <hi>Hat!</hi> (No, nor likely, any <hi>Leathern Britches,</hi> and <hi>Fox</hi> had both) nor in <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou,</hi> becauſe <hi>Judas</hi> did not ſpeak <hi>Engliſh! And then</hi> (as ſays <hi>Appen.</hi>) G. Fox <hi>has (in his own Fooliſh and Falſe words) The Glory of being an Original.</hi> Whoſe <hi>Fooliſh</hi> and <hi>Falſe</hi> words? Certainly he means this for the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of <hi>Prim. Heres.</hi> But they are not his words, he only Quotes them from <hi>Will.

                  </p>
                  <p>But, to make an End of this Head, <hi>Appen.</hi> ſays, p. 50. <hi>As for our</hi> Hats, <hi>we pull them not off in</hi>—<hi>Civility</hi>—<hi>yet we pay</hi>—<hi>Civility to all Men.</hi> You mean, ſome other way, but not in that. So ſay you <hi>(ibid.)</hi> we give <hi>Honour to whom Honour is Due.</hi> It has been told be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whom they are, to whom you think it Due. But if you think that any <hi>Honour</hi> at all
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:95758:200"/>is <hi>Due</hi> to <hi>our Magiſtrates,</hi> then this <hi>Particular Honour</hi> of the <hi>Hat,</hi> and <hi>Civil Titles</hi> are <hi>Due,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>Requir'd. Honour</hi> is as much <hi>Due</hi> to our <hi>Governors,</hi> as <hi>Tribute:</hi> And you may as well ſay we will Pay <hi>Tribute to whom Tribute is Due:</hi> but we will not Pay this <hi>Particular Tribute,</hi> which is <hi>Requir'd.</hi> We may as juſtly Cut and Carve for our ſelves what ſort of <hi>Tribute,</hi> as what ſort of <hi>Honour</hi> to Pay. We muſt Pay that which is <hi>Requir'd,</hi> or elſe we are <hi>Offenders.</hi> Unleſs we can ſhew ſome Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive <hi>Prohibition</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> againſt it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it Returns now upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſince they Acknowlege ſome <hi>Honour</hi> to be Due, to ſhew where God has Forbidden that <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Honour</hi> of the <hi>Hat,</hi> or other <hi>Addreſs</hi> than <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou,</hi> elſe they are <hi>Tranſgreſſors</hi> as well againſt the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as of <hi>Man.</hi> If they ſay, that their <hi>Light</hi> forbids it (for they can ſhew nothing elſe) then may it not Forbid any other ſort of <hi>Honour,</hi> as well as the <hi>Hat,</hi> or <hi>Titles?</hi> or any ſort of <hi>Tribute,</hi> as it has done <hi>Tythes, Trophy-Money,</hi> &amp;c. So that all our <hi>Laws,</hi> all <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> among <hi>Men,</hi> all things whatſoever, lie at the <hi>Mercy</hi> of the <hi>Quakers:</hi> while they Refuſe to let <hi>Scripture,</hi> or any thing elſe, be a <hi>Rule</hi> to their <hi>Light;</hi> but ſet <hi>It</hi> up <hi>Paramount,</hi> as the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Standart,</hi> to <hi>Confirm</hi> or to <hi>Annul</hi> all <hi>Laws, Customs, Conſtitutions,</hi> even the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> themſelves. As Ample as the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Jeremiah, over the Nations, and over the Kingdoms, to Root out, and to Pull down, and to Deſtroy, and to Throw down, to Build, and to Plant.</hi> If it be not ſo, and that the <hi>Quakers</hi>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:95758:200"/>will ſay, They are willing to take the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> for their <hi>Rule:</hi> Then let them ſhew any <hi>Scripture</hi> which Forbids that Particular <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Hat,</hi> or of <hi>Civil-Titles:</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe let them <hi>Confeſs,</hi> That the <hi>Light</hi> which has told them ſo is <hi>Darkneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the truth is, They do not Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> as their <hi>Rule,</hi> which is ſhewn before p. 29, 30. And <hi>Will. Penn</hi> has this Year 1699, <hi>Printed,</hi> tho' not <hi>Publiſh'd,</hi> except to the <hi>Friends</hi> (for their <hi>Book-Sellers</hi> Refuſe to Sell them, unleſs they know to whom, they Refus'd it to ſome that I imploy'd) <hi>A Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the General Rule of Faith and Practice,</hi> of which the whole <hi>Argument</hi> is, <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> to <hi>Prove,</hi> That the <hi>Scriptures</hi> cannot be that <hi>Rule.</hi> Wherein all the <hi>Popiſh Artillery</hi> is <hi>Muſter'd</hi> up, againſt the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> being the <hi>Rule.</hi> It has Receiv'd a very Subſtantial <hi>Anſwer</hi> by <hi>G. Keith,</hi> therefore I ſay no more of it here. But to take Notice of the <hi>Deceit</hi> of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> in their <hi>Quoting</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi> For to what Purpoſe do they <hi>Quote</hi> them, when they Own them not to be the <hi>Rule;</hi> And Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, will not be <hi>Determin'd</hi> by them? This is only to <hi>Amuſe,</hi> and to bear a <hi>Face,</hi> as if they <hi>Own'd</hi> the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> And to uſe them, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> againſt thoſe who do <hi>Acknowledge</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>Yet they have no <hi>Proof,</hi> but what they <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi> from <hi>Scripture,</hi> for their <hi>Foundation-Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> of The <hi>Light within</hi> (which they make the only <hi>Rule</hi>) being <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>God.</hi> They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, that the <hi>Light within</hi> do's tell them this of its Self: For then it wou'd tell others
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95758:201"/>ſo, Seeing they make it <hi>Common</hi> to all <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:</hi> And: if it tells None ſo, but the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi> or if it do's not tell all Others ſo, as well as the <hi>Quakers,</hi> then how is it the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule</hi> to All <hi>Men,</hi> as the <hi>Quakers</hi> wou'd have it? Therefore they have Recourſe, for this, to <hi>Joh.</hi> i. 9. <hi>That was the true Light, which Lighteth every Man that Cometh into the World.</hi> And to other <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which they <hi>Wreſt,</hi> to their own <hi>Deſtruction.</hi> And yet they will not Own the <hi>Scriptures</hi> for the <hi>Rule.</hi> But, when <hi>Pinch'd,</hi> they Fly back again to their <hi>Light-within.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is all they have for their <hi>Principle</hi> of the <hi>Hat;</hi> and their <hi>Sulleneſs,</hi> which they call <hi>Gravity.</hi>
                  </p>

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:95758:208"/>indeed, I think, it cannot be Anſwer'd. It is a full Demonſtration, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> Deny all <hi>Natural</hi> Light, all that ever Mankind meant by the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> They will have no <hi>Light</hi> in <hi>Man,</hi> but the very <hi>Original</hi> Divine <hi>Light,</hi> which is <hi>God,</hi> And this is the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of all their Horrible <hi>Hereſies,</hi> as ſhewn in <hi>Prim.

                  </p>
                  <p>This do's neceſſarily <hi>Inferr,</hi> that every <hi>Man</hi> is <hi>God:</hi> for this <hi>Light</hi> which is <hi>God,</hi> howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be, in it ſelf, <hi>Supernatural</hi> to us, yet, if, as <hi>W.

And this is, to beat down that Notion of any <hi>Natural Light</hi> in <hi>Man. Thom. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> in his Book call'd <hi>The Lip of Truth opened.</hi> Printed 1656. p. 47. ſays, <hi>As for a Natural Light, the Scriptures mention no ſuch thing; ſo when thou writes again, acquaint People what thou means by</hi> Natural; <hi>the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a</hi> Divine <hi>Nature, which the Saints were Partakers of.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. But why do's <hi>Thom. Lawſon</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this to the <hi>Saints?</hi> Here the <hi>Quakers</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found themſelves. For they ſay, That <hi>every Man that comes into the World</hi> is <hi>Partaker</hi> of the <hi>Light within:</hi> But the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here (even as <hi>T. L.</hi> interprets it) ſays of none but the <hi>Saints,</hi> that they are <hi>Partakers</hi> of the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature: which is Plainly the Import of that <hi>Text.</hi> And therefore, the <hi>Light within,</hi> and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:95758:209"/>the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> are two things. Becauſe ſome may Partake of the <hi>One,</hi> who do not of the <hi>Other.</hi> Yet <hi>T. L.</hi> will not allow of <hi>Two</hi> Lights. Or that ther is any <hi>Light</hi> in <hi>Man,</hi> that can be call'd <hi>Natural, Spiritual, Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Grace,</hi> for which his Adverſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, in theſe very words. But he Anſwers p. 42. <hi>The Light is but one, even Christ.</hi> and p. 43. <hi>No Light we own, but Chriſt, who Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every one.</hi> i. e. The <hi>Light within</hi> is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Inſpiration</hi> from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>Christ Himſelf.</hi> Nothing is more a <hi>Receiv'd</hi> and <hi>Common</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the <hi>Quakers</hi> than this; nor more <hi>Zealouſly</hi> contended for. Tho' now they wou'd <hi>Smooth</hi> and <hi>Cover</hi> it, when they ſee it is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roly <hi>Diſcover'd,</hi> and thereby grown <hi>Odious</hi> to the <hi>Eyes</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you wou'd know (for it ſeems ſtrange) why they are ſo Earneſt againſt any <hi>Natural</hi> Light.

And thinking that they have no <hi>Light</hi> but this, conſequently, whatever comes into their Heads, they muſt think it to be the very <hi>Voice</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And then in vain is either <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Reaſon</hi> urg'd to Remove them. For they think they have what is <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> within them. This Renders them (as we find them) <hi>Deaf</hi> to all <hi>Arguments.</hi> This is the moſt Dreadful <hi>Snare</hi> of the <hi>Devil;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in when any are Caught, they are Proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Conviction</hi> or <hi>Repentance,</hi> even in the moſt

                  <p>This is the true Ground why the <hi>Quakers</hi> will not allow any <hi>Light</hi> that is in <hi>Man</hi> to be <hi>Natural;</hi> no, not that <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Reaſon</hi> which is <hi>Common</hi> to <hi>All Men.</hi> Nor will be Content to ſay That this <hi>comes</hi> from <hi>God.</hi> No. They will have it nothing Leſs than <hi>God</hi> Himſelf.

                  <p>This was the <hi>Ranters</hi> Blaſphemous <hi>Notion.</hi> That <hi>God</hi> is Every thing: And Every thing is <hi>God.</hi> Thus they Underſtand that <hi>Text,</hi> That <hi>God is All in All.</hi> i. e.

It will give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Plainer <hi>View</hi> of this their Principle. And they Complain often, that their Words are given too Short, and the whole Sentences not

                  <q>So now this <hi>Chriſt</hi> was before the World (that now is) began, and was a <hi>Seed</hi> before any Name was given to it; which, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, being <hi>Begotten</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> was <hi>Born</hi> of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> had a <hi>Body</hi> Prepared to do the will of his Father (as it is at this Day;) But none knows him (or ever ſhall) <hi>Born,</hi> but of a <hi>Virgin</hi> (he that hath Ears, let him hear) Whoſe Eye is Single, Mind ſtayed on God, Forſakes all, takes up the dayly Croſs, denies Self—Theſe only know him <hi>Born,</hi> tho' once, like <hi>Mary,</hi> ſaid, <hi>How can this be, Seeing I know not a Man?</hi> (Seeing I have no <hi>Strength, Wiſdom, Parts,</hi> or <hi>Abilities</hi> of my Own:) But the Anſwer is, at it was, (Be thou but the <hi>Virgin</hi>) <hi>The Power of the Moſt High ſhall Over-Shadow thee, And that Holy thing, which ſhall be Born of thee, ſhall be Called the Son of God:</hi> This was <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Name in the Womb, a <hi>Holy thing.</hi> Read within—This is the I AM, which was before <hi>Abraham</hi>—the <hi>Virgin</hi> is Subject to the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Moſt High,</hi> Where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is known to be firſt a <hi>Holy thing,</hi> then a <hi>Child</hi> given <hi>&amp;c.

                  </q>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Will. Bayly.</hi> And, by this, you ſee, That they make <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be all <hi>One.</hi> That this <hi>God</hi> was a <hi>Seed,</hi> before any <hi>Name</hi>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:95758:216"/>was givin to it. <hi>i. e.</hi> from <hi>Eternity.</hi> That this <hi>God,</hi> do's <hi>in proceſs of time,</hi> even <hi>at this Day,</hi> Beget <hi>God, IN</hi> Us. That this <hi>God</hi> do's <hi>Grow</hi> and <hi>Encreaſe IN</hi> Us, from a <hi>Seed,</hi> to a <hi>Child,</hi> then to a <hi>Son,</hi> laſtly, to be the <hi>MIGHTY GOD,</hi> the <hi>EVERLASTING FATHER!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again you ſee, how they <hi>Allegorize</hi> the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> of Whom <hi>CHRIST</hi> was <hi>Born,</hi> to a <hi>Pure</hi> or <hi>Virgin HEART.</hi> That when <hi>Mary</hi> ſaid, ſhe knew not a <hi>Man,</hi> by <hi>Man</hi> here was only Meant <hi>Our own Wiſdom, Strength, Parts,</hi> or <hi>Abilities,</hi> out of which <hi>Chriſt</hi> cou'd not be <hi>Born.</hi> That they know Him <hi>Born</hi> of them, at this <hi>Day,</hi> as <hi>Mary</hi> knew Him <hi>Born</hi> of Her.</p>
                  <p>And indeed it do's not Appear, That they think Him to have been <hi>Born</hi> any otherwiſe of Her, than He is of Them. that is, Not of her <hi>Body,</hi> in a <hi>Literal</hi> Senſe, but only in the <hi>Womb</hi> of her <hi>Heart,</hi> as in Theirs!</p>
                  <p>They ſay that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Light</hi> is <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> But they ſay not this of that <hi>Prepared Body</hi> (as they call it) of <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi> in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> or the <hi>Light</hi> Dwelt, which was <hi>Literally</hi> Born of the <hi>Virgin MARY.</hi> Whom they do not (that I can find) own to have been a <hi>Virgin,</hi> in the Common Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Word, that is, who had no <hi>Carnal Knowlege</hi> of a <hi>Man:</hi> but only that ſhe had a <hi>Pure,</hi> that is a <hi>Virgin HEART.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are Deſir'd to tell us, who they think was the <hi>Immediate Father,</hi> not of <hi>Chriſt</hi> or the <hi>Light,</hi> but of that <hi>Prepared Body</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth?</hi> Whether they think, as ſome <hi>Socinians</hi> have done, that it was <hi>Begot</hi>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:95758:217"/>by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in the Ordinary way of <hi>Generation?</hi> If they <hi>Wave</hi> giving any <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this, It is <hi>Owning</hi> that they do think ſo. For if they Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as all other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do, they can have no <hi>Scruple</hi> in <hi>Owning</hi> of it. Eſpecially <hi>Now,</hi> when they are upon <hi>Smoothing</hi> of their <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and Endeavouring to make them Appear the ſame with other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> particularly with the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of the 39 <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in their Anſwer to this, I here give them Caution, to Avoid <hi>Ambiguity</hi> of Terms. That they Word it not, Who was the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> for they can call their <hi>Light within</hi> ſometimes by the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that is, a <hi>Saviour,</hi> as well as by the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, <hi>Anointed:</hi> But that they Anſwer Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, Who was the <hi>Father</hi> of that <hi>Outward Body</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary.</hi> And that they ſay not only, Who was his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> for they may ſay, it was <hi>God;</hi> which is true, in a Large Senſe, as He is the <hi>Father</hi> of All <hi>Living:</hi> But that they tell, Who was his <hi>IMMEDIATE Father.</hi> And whether He was <hi>Begotten</hi> of Any <hi>Mere</hi> Mortal <hi>Man?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Deſire them to keep in the word <hi>Mortal,</hi> becauſe they have a Notion of an <hi>Eternal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> of <hi>God</hi> (as ſhewn in the beginning of the <hi>Firſt Part</hi>) Therefore, I Deſire they may ſay, whether our <hi>Jeſus,</hi> was <hi>Begotten</hi> of any <hi>MOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAL Man?</hi> And becauſe they have a <hi>Senſe</hi> too, in which they think that <hi>God</hi> or the <hi>Light</hi> may <hi>Dye</hi> in Our <hi>Hearts,</hi> Therefore, that they add the word <hi>Mere</hi> to <hi>Mortal,</hi> and ſay, Whether the <hi>Outward Body</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> which
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:95758:217"/>was <hi>Born</hi> of <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Wife</hi> of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> was <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten</hi> by any <hi>Mere Mortal Man?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ther is Need of all this <hi>Caution</hi> with theſe <hi>Quakers,</hi> as ſufficiently ſhewn before. It is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible otherwiſe to Hold them! Ther are None who have ſuch <hi>Starting-Holes</hi> and <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> as they have: With all their <hi>Pretences</hi> to <hi>Flainneſs</hi> and <hi>Sincerity!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if they ſhall <hi>Anſwer,</hi> in the <hi>Terms</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet down, That <hi>Jeſus</hi> was <hi>IMMEDIAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY Begotten</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> in the <hi>Womb</hi> of the B. <hi>Virgin:</hi> Then that they give a Good Reaſon, Why He was not <hi>Properly</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Or otherwiſe, That they <hi>Diſown</hi> that Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their <hi>Belief</hi> which <hi>Will. Penn</hi> has Given, and ſays it in their Name, <hi>viz. That the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Perſon which Suffer'd was</hi> Properly <hi>the Son of God, We <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tterly Deny.</hi> As has been before Quoted from p. 146. of his <hi>Serious Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then let them <hi>Own,</hi> That <hi>Chriſt</hi> was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Begotten</hi> and <hi>Born</hi> of the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin,</hi> than He is in their <hi>Hearts,</hi> or Ever was, or will be in any other <hi>Perſon.</hi> That only at that Time, in the <hi>Womb</hi> of the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin,</hi> and Never Before, He did Aſſume our <hi>Fleſh</hi> into an <hi>Hypoſtatical</hi> or <hi>Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with His <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature:</hi> And that He is now <hi>Truly</hi> and <hi>Properly</hi> a <hi>Man,</hi> in <hi>Compleat</hi> Human <hi>Nature,</hi> of an <hi>Human Soul,</hi> and <hi>Human Body,</hi> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>Truly</hi> and <hi>Properly</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> (Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Will.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:95758:218"/>many Words, Leſs <hi>Particular</hi> and <hi>Poſitive</hi> will not do with theſe Men. It is for their ſakes that I do it, That I may, by any Means, if Poſſible, Open their Eyes, to <hi>Diſcover</hi> their <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Deluſions!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They have, by this Means of <hi>Allegorizing</hi> the <hi>Incarnation</hi> and <hi>Birth</hi> of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> from the <hi>Letter,</hi> to their Imagined <hi>Conception, Birth, Paſſion, Death,</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>Light within,</hi> taken away all <hi>Certainty</hi> whereby we may know, Whether ever ther was Such a <hi>Man</hi> in the World as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or that He ever did any <hi>Miracle,</hi> or had any <hi>Atteſtation</hi> from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> for His <hi>Miniſtry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Moſt Expreſs, of the <hi>Glorious Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of a <hi>Light</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> Deſcending <hi>Leaſurly</hi> and <hi>Hovering,</hi> upon the <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> at His <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> after the Manner that a <hi>Dove</hi> Lights upon the Ground, the <hi>Quakers</hi> have <hi>Deny'd,</hi> that is, turn'd it to an <hi>Allegorie. Doeſt thou believe</hi> (ſays <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> to his Opponent, in his <hi>Truth Defending the Quakers.</hi> p. 42.) <hi>That it was viſible to the Carnal Eye, as a Created Dove is? or its Lightning</hi> (I believe he Meant <hi>Lighting</hi>) <hi>upon Him as a Dove, was in reſpect of its Nature and Comlineſs?</hi> By this they Mean, That <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> and <hi>Simplicity,</hi> like that of a <hi>Dove,</hi> was all that did Light upon <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or which Expreſt His <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Comlineſs,</hi> at that Time. And then indeed they might well Ask, <hi>Was it viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Carnal Eye?</hi> But, by this, they have Quite <hi>Overthrown</hi> the <hi>Validity</hi> of that <hi>Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Atteſtation</hi> given to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> And ſo they have done to all the Reſt. That, as I ſaid, they have not left <hi>One Single Proof,</hi> that Ever ther
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:95758:218"/>was ſuch a Man in the World. For that can not be known, but by <hi>Outward Acts,</hi> and <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations.</hi> And if they can be thus Turn'd, ther is an End of all <hi>Proof</hi> from them.</p>
                  <p>But they wou'd have no other <hi>Proof</hi> for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or His <hi>Miſſion,</hi> than ther is for their Own: Since they vouch <hi>Themſelves</hi> to be <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>God!</hi> Indeed, as many <hi>Gods,</hi> as ther are <hi>Quakers!</hi> For if, as they ſay, the <hi>Seed</hi> in them can <hi>Grow</hi> up to be <hi>God:</hi> That <hi>God</hi> do's <hi>BEGET Himſelf</hi> in them: Then I do not ſee how they can avoid the Conſequence of a <hi>Multiplication</hi> of <hi>Gods!</hi> Of <hi>God</hi>'s having a <hi>Beginning,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Created!</hi> For if He be <hi>Begotten</hi> in <hi>Time,</hi> Every <hi>Day,</hi> in Every New <hi>Quaker,</hi> He muſt be <hi>Created,</hi> and ſo, is both the <hi>Creature,</hi> and the <hi>Creator!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If He be Capable of <hi>Encreaſe,</hi> of <hi>Growing</hi> up from a <hi>Seed,</hi> to a <hi>Child</hi> &amp;c. He muſt likewiſe be Subject to <hi>Diſſolution!</hi> He muſt be Lyable to <hi>Infirmities</hi> and <hi>Paſſions,</hi> as We are!</p>
                  <p>And this the <hi>Quakers</hi> do not Deny. Nay, they Argue Expreſly for it. They take in a <hi>Literal</hi> Senſe thoſe Expreſſions in <hi>Scripture,</hi> Where <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to <hi>Repent,</hi> to be <hi>Weary,</hi> to <hi>Suffer</hi> &amp;c. ſeveral of which <hi>G.

                  <p>Theſe are the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi> of this <hi>Mad Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Quaker Faith,</hi> in Setting up their <hi>Light Within</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>God.</hi>

                           <p>SInce the Breach and Diviſion has happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>among the <hi>Quakers</hi> here in <hi>America</hi> about the chief Doctrines &amp; Principles of the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> great has been the Noiſe they have made in the World one againſt another, each endeavouring to clear themſelves, &amp; caſt blame upon the contrary party; ſo that many who live remote, are amazed at this Difference, not knowing where to lay the fault, both Parties pretending to <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> But there lately coming ſome Papers to my hand, which ſeem pertinent to make ſome further diſcovery in this Controverſie, I thought my ſelf obliged to commit them to publick view, for the Information of all <hi>Chriſtian Enquirers.</hi> And further, I do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that this Difference among the <hi>Quakers</hi> first began in <hi>Pennſilvania,</hi> in the year <hi>1691.</hi> occaſioned by Mr. <hi>George Keith</hi>'s more earnestly preaching up the Perſon of our Saviour, the Neceſſity of Faith in him, as he Dyed, was Buried, Roſe again and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, and as he is now in Heaven in the true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, our Mediator &amp; Interceſſor, and as he ſhall come again outwardly at the end of the World to judge the Quick &amp; Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95758:230"/>ſort of Doctrine was diſliked by many of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> &amp; cauſed many private Conferences among themſelves, &amp; at last a prevailing party Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated Mr. <hi>Keith</hi> out of their Society, but a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Number of <hi>Quakers</hi> ſtood by and vindicated him and his Doctrine, and they ſet up ſeveral new Meetings, (as I am informed about twelve, in and near <hi>Pennſilvania</hi>) and Mr. <hi>Keith</hi> undertakes to write and print againſt the Errors of his old Friends, and tells the World, <hi>That there are ſuch Damnable Doctrines and Hereſies cloaked among the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> here, that no</hi> Proteſtant Society <hi>in</hi> Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>would tolerate the like.</hi> His old Friends ſay they are belyed by Mr. <hi>Keith;</hi> This has made ſome to be curious in ſearching into this Controverſie; and among the rest my very good Friend Coll. <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> late Governour of <hi>Carolina,</hi> now reſiding in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> has made ſome diligent enquiry into this Controverſy, but received not full ſatsfaction (as he informs me) whether Mr. <hi>Keith,</hi> and theſe joyned with him, had falſly charged their old Friends, or not. And there lately coming to his hands, (very providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially) a Copy of <hi>Queries,</hi> ſent by Dr. <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to the General Meeting of the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>London</hi> laſt <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> and not hearing of an Anſwer to the ſame, Mr. <hi>Quarry</hi> preſents them to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Meeting of the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Philadelphia, viz.</hi> both to that Meeting which joyn with Mr. <hi>Keith,</hi> and to that Meeting which Excommunicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, deſiring their Anſwer to each <hi>Query.</hi> That Meeting or Party of <hi>Quakers</hi> which joyn with Mr. <hi>Keith</hi> readily returned their Anſwer in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Collonel, which is hereunto annexed. The other Meeting of <hi>Quakers</hi> which have Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated Mr. <hi>Keith</hi> ſend three Meſſengers to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95758:230"/>Collonel, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jenings,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Puſey,</hi> who acquainted him, <hi>That they received his Letter, with the Queries annexed, which</hi> (they ſaid) <hi>were read in their general Meeting, but not</hi> knowing <hi>whether their Friends in</hi> London <hi>had anſwered them, or not, they did not think fit to anſwer, till they had an account from their ſaid Friends, and what Anſwer their</hi> London <hi>Friends gave, they would ſtand by,</hi> or to that effect. Whereupon the Collonel told them, That indeed they lay under ſevere Reflections, as to their ſoundneſs in the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and their anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid Queries might have cleared them, and given the world ſatisfaction of their ſoundneſs therein. To which Mr. <hi>Jenings</hi> replyed, <hi>That tho' by the ſaid Paper of Queries it was inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, that they turned the Scripture into an Allegory, yet they did really believe that Chriſt was born, ſuffered, dyed, was buried, and roſe again outwardly.</hi> But he stopping there, the Coll. repeated his words, adding, I alſo believe, that the ſame Body that ſo Aroſe, did Aſcend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is now in Heaven, and will come again at the end of the world, to judge the quick and the dead. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which Mr. <hi>Puſey</hi> (it ſeems) took up the Coll. very ſhort, and interrogated him, <hi>Whether he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that Chriſt's outward Body of Fleſh, Blood and Bones aſcended into Heaven?</hi> To which, when the Collonel anſwered, <hi>Yea,</hi> Mr. <hi>Puſey</hi> Replyed, <hi>The Scripture ſays, Fleſh and Blood ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> &amp;c. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which the Collonel told him, <hi>He was ſorry to find they underſtood the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no better; and that he now perceived the Accuſations againſt ſome of them was not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95758:231"/>altogether groundleſs.</hi> But. Mr. <hi>Jenings</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately brake off the Diſcourſe, (whether upon finding his Friend Mr. <hi>Puſey</hi> had like to have ſpoiled all by diſcovering their Error, I'll not here determine, and) ſaying, <hi>We came not here to diſcourſe, but to do our Meſſage,</hi> took leave, and departed.</p>
                           <p>I ſhall not here make any further Obſervation upon theſe Anſwers from each party of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but commit the matter of fact to publick view, and leave every man to judge for himſelf, hoping it may make ſome further diſcovery into this great Controverſie among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> about the fundamental Principles and Doctrins of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion,</hi> and ſhew which party is the moſt <hi>Orthodox.</hi> I ſhall only add, <hi>Read impartially</hi> and <hi>judge Candidly.</hi> I am yours in all Offices of Love, and for the promoting the Cauſe and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the <hi>crucified Jeſus,</hi> and his ſincere Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>

                                 <p>I Have ſpent ſome time in peruſing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what hath been printed on both ſides, in reference to the Difference and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes which hath lately happened betwixt you and ſome of your Friends; and upon the whole matter I muſt own and declare, That as to the ſaving Fundamentals of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> in Controverſie betwixt you and t'other Meeting, you have declar'd and publiſh'd to the World, <hi>That your Principles and Doctrine, in thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Points, are ſound and Orthodox, conſonant and agreeable to the Scriptures, and Church of Chriſt in all Ages.</hi> But although it be my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet knowing my own weakneſs, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſible that many of thoſe called <hi>Quakers</hi> do abuſe the World with falſe Gloſſes and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Terms, hiding their true meaning, and impoſing falſe Notions on People, therefore I am not willing to truſt my own Judgment, without a further confirmation. And Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath given me an extraordinary oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to be fully ſatisfied, I having lately met with a Copy of Queries, ſent by <hi>Dr. Lancaſter</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> to the Yearly Meeting of your Friends there met laſt <hi>Whitſuntide,</hi> the anſwer to which I have not heard of nor ſeen, and

                  <hi>A FAITHFUL RELATION</hi> Of the great Oppoſition, made by ſome Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers among the Quakers, to three great funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrins of the Chriſtian Faith, at Two ſeveral Meetings, at <hi>London,</hi> in the year <hi>1678,</hi> appointed to hear the Charges made by them againſt me <hi>George Keith,</hi> for my aſſerting the ſaid Three Fundamental Doctrins, in my Book call'd <hi>The way caſt up.</hi> Printed <hi>1677.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AND The Reaſons of my Publiſhing the ſaid Relation.</p>
               <p>IN the Year 1678, at <hi>London,</hi> there being great Whiſperings and Complaints, private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpread among the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> againſt Me; on the Account of Certain Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples laid down by Me, in a Book of Mine, Printed in the Year 1677 called, <hi>The way Caſt up,</hi> And I happening to be then at <hi>London,</hi> and hearing of the ſaid Complaints againſt me, and my ſaid Book, I ſpoke to diverſe of the Miniſtry, of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they would appoint a Meeting, to hear the Complaints of thoſe Perſons that Object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt ſome things Contain'd in my Book, charging them to be Falſe and Erronious, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95758:236"/>alſo to hear my Defence, and Vindication, touching the things to be charged againſt me.</p>
               <p>A Meeting was procured, at a Friends houſe call'd <hi>John Oſgood,</hi> a Merchant in <hi>White-Hart-</hi> Court in <hi>Grace-Church-ſtreet London,</hi> in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Seaſon, which began about the Sixth hour at Night; where a Conſiderable number of thoſe called Friends of the Miniſtry were met together, with divers other Perſons of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> among whom were <hi>William Penn, George Whitehead, Thomas Green, William Mead, William Gibſon, George Watt, Francis More, Thomas Hart, James Claypowl, John Bull;</hi> And many other beſides.</p>
               <p>The perſons that appeared againſt me at the ſaid Meeting, were chiefly <hi>Samuel Newtown,</hi> a great Preacher then among them, (who not long after Broke, and went to <hi>Virginia,</hi> and ſtill Preacheth there among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as I have been certainly inform'd by ſome that heard him, and are ready to bear witneſs to it,) and <hi>William Shewen</hi> a Preacher, and a great Writer among them, who hath Printed divers Books highly approved by many of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Quakers;</hi> Containing ſome abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Principles, whereof I have given ſome account in my Second and Third Narratives, of the Proceedings at <hi>Turners-Hall;</hi> This man was never. Cenſured by Friends of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry for his Antichriſtian Doctrin Contained in ſome of his Books, but lived and dyed in Unity with them, and had Solemn Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, and Teſtimonies given him by ſome of the Miniſtry at his Funeral.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:95758:237"/>The firſt Meeting not having time ſufficient to hear all that was to be ſaid, for and againſt, appointed another Meeting at the houſe of <hi>James Claypool</hi> Merchant in <hi>Scotch Yard</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> when ſome others were preſent, and moſtly all the foremention'd: the Meeting began about the Sixth hour at night as did the former.</p>
               <p>The particulars were Three eſpecially, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with theſe two above named Perſons ſeverally charged me and blamed my Doctrine, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed againſt it, to be Contradictory to the Ancient Friends Books, whereof they brought a Conſiderable number, which were laid on the Table; but it happened that none of them were uſed, but inſtead of them, the Bible was called for, and ſome places in it read and Diſcours'd upon.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Particular they blam'd in my ſaid Book, and charg'd to be falſe, was, that I had affirmed that Chriſt's Body that was Crucified on the Tree of the Croſs, and was Buried,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 131.</note> Roſe again, and Aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and was in Heaven. Diverſe ſpoke their mind to it, one after another, ſome againſt it, and ſome for it, and ſome very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, which I was greatly aſtoniſhed to find. I Quoted that place of Scripture, in defence of the Reſurrection of Chriſt's Body. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 2.30, 31, 32. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell, nor ſuffer thy holy one to ſee Corruption. Will. Mead</hi> ſaid to me, doſt thou underſtand this of an outward Body? that which was not to ſee Corruption, was the Seed within. I anſwered, let the places
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95758:237"/>be read and compared, and it will be found, that they are to be underſtood of Chriſt's Body that was laid in the outward Grave, ſo theſe two places of Scripture were read, and ſeveral gave their aſſent to it, that by the Holy one that was not to ſee Corruption, was to be underſtood Chriſt's Body that was laid in the Grave; whereupon <hi>Thomas Green</hi> an ancient Preacher ſaid, Friends, one of two things we muſt needs ſay, either that Chriſt's Body remains in ſome hole or cave of the Earth, or that it Roſe and Aſcended, for it did not ſee Corruption; and for my part I rather think it Roſe and Aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as <hi>George Keith</hi> affirms, than that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in any hole or cave of the Earth. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe other places of Scripture I had, to bring forth to prove the truth of the Reſurrection of Chriſt's Body, as his own words to the <hi>Jews; Deſtroy this Temple</hi> (meaning his Body) <hi>and after three days I will raiſe it up,</hi> and his appearing to his Diſciples after his Reſurrect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; having ſaid, as it is <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.39. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle me, and Feel me, for a Spirit hath no Fleſh and Bones, as ye ſee me have.</hi> After <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Green</hi> had ſpoke, as is above related: <hi>George Whitehead</hi> ſaid, that whereas many both Prieſts and Profeſſors had queſtioned Friends much concerning Chriſt's Body, what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of it, and where it was? by occaſion of Friends Preaching Chriſt within ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he confeſſes that Friends were at ſome ſtand to give a poſſitive anſwer, but rather evaded the Queſtion. And though in former times, Friends were ſhy to anſwer the Prieſts
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95758:238"/>and Profeſſors Queſtions about Chriſt's Body, fearing they ſought by their ſubtilty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare them, yet now <hi>George Keith</hi> has given a plain anſwer to their Queſtion; he tells them Chriſt's Body is Aſcended into Heaven, and is in Heaven.<note place="margin">Note this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fallacy <hi>G. W.</hi> knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that what I had aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about Chriſt's Body, his Aſcenſion into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, did contradict both his and his Brethren's Doctrine.</note> He doth Contradict what Friends had formerly ſaid, but is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and plain in his anſwer to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors queſtion. So my oppoſers ceaſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more to object againſt me upon that Head.</p>
               <p>The Second Particular they charged againſt me, was that in my Book I had ſaid, the Friends did pray to Chriſt Jeſus, and did Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Pray unto the Mediator betwixt God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, the Anointed King, Prieſt and Prophet of his People, who alſo is God over all, bleſſed for ever, <hi>pag.</hi> 123. of <hi>The way caſt up.</hi> And whereas I had ſet down ſome words of prayers that I had ſaid I had heard ſome uſe in our own Meetings, and I had uſed, as Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſon of <hi>David</hi> had mercy on us (<hi>pag.</hi> 121.) O thou bleſſed Lord Jeſus, that wert Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Dyed for our ſins, and ſhed thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood for us, be gracious unto us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the which prayer containeth a whole page in Print; wherein alſo the forgiveneſs of our ſins is prayed for (a thing many ſay, they never heard in a <hi>Quaker's</hi> Meeting) to this theſe two men obſerved, that it was a ſort of Popery, but with this difference; that the Papiſts prayed both to the Mother, and the Son: <hi>George Keith</hi> though he prayed not to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95758:238"/>the Mother, yet he prayed to the Son. Some preſent ſaid it was a part of Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to ſay, Son of <hi>David</hi> have mercy on us, but theſe two before mention'd Perſons, my chief oppoſers, put me hard to it, to give ſome Inſtance, where ever I heard any anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Friend of the Miniſtry, that was an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man, pray to Chriſt Jeſus: It is poſſible (ſaid they) thou haſt heard ſome <hi>Scotch</hi> Friends pray ſo, whom thou haſt taught ſo, and were thy Proſelites. I confeſs I was at a ſtand, to name any one Engliſh man, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I heard ſo pray, though in <hi>Scotland,</hi> I would have named one. But <hi>William Penn</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me, and ſaid, Friends I am an. Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh man, and a Freind of the Miniſtry: I have oft prayed to Chriſt Jeſus, to my great comfort, and have been anſwered. And not long ago, being under ſome great weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Spirit, and like to have been ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by a power of Darkneſs; I uttered theſe words (its true I was in private) Lord Jeſus who was Crucified for me, have mercy on me; and immediately I was eaſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. They objected, that <hi>William Penn</hi> was but a young Miniſter: Let <hi>George Keith</hi> give an inſtance, what ancient <hi>Engliſh</hi> Friend of the Miniſtry he ever heard pray to Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. As I could remember none, ſo nor did any in all the Meeting give an Inſtance. But ſaid <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> it is not what <hi>William Penn,</hi> or <hi>George Keith</hi> ſaith, let the Scripture decide it; whereupon he call'd for the Bible, and reads in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Church
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95758:239"/>of God, which is at</hi> Corinth, <hi>to them that are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, call'd to be Saints, with all that in every place, call upon the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, both theirs and ours.</hi> What ſay ye to this Friends? ye ſee, that <hi>Paul</hi> did-approve the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that called upon the name of the Lord Jeſus. [<hi>Note Reader one would think that if</hi> G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head <hi>had made it his practiſe to pray to Chriſt Jeſus, being an ancient Miniſter, and uſing to pray frequently in the publick Meetings of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple call'd</hi> Quakers, <hi>he would have named himſelf to have been one who had prayed to Christ Jeſus, or ſome that had oft heard him, ther preſent, might have given him for an inſtance, but no inſtance was brought of any Engliſh ancient Friend of the Miniſtry, who had ever been heard ſo to pray; and had it been a frequent practiſe among them, to call upon the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it could not be ſuppoſed to be poſſible that theſe two men my oppoſers could have objected it againſt me, as a novelty, or ſuch a ſingular prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, as that no Engliſh ancient Friend could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as a witneſs for that practiſe</hi>] their anſwe to <hi>George Whitehead's</hi> Queſtion was, <hi>Paul</hi> was dark and ignorant in that thing, as <hi>George Keith</hi> is: for our parts we know better. <hi>George Whitehead</hi> reply'd, hold Friends, ſay not ſo. Ye know, we have been accuſed by divers, that we eſteem our ſelves equal to the Apoſtles, which for my part I never did; how will this be received by Profeſſors, if they ſhou'd hear, that we did ſet up our ſelves above them, and above <hi>Paul,</hi> one of the chiefeſt of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95758:239"/>them: after he had ſo plentifully received the Holy Ghoſt, and had planted ſo many Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es? Pray let us not exalt our ſelves above <hi>Paul,</hi> it is very well if we be where he was. But they ſtill continued blaming my aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my Book, for ſaying, that Chriſt was to be prayed unto, and eſpecially they blam'd the manner of praying to him, by the name Son of <hi>David;</hi> objecting againſt one of the prooffs in my Book, how <hi>Bartimeus</hi> pray'd to Chriſt in theſe words, <hi>Son of</hi> David <hi>have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on me.</hi> Poor blind <hi>Bartimeus</hi> (ſaid they) had <hi>George Keith</hi> no better Arguments for him, than blind <hi>Bartimeus?</hi> he was as blind in his Soul, as he was in his Body. <hi>Thomas Hart</hi> replyed to them, Friends ſay not ſo, ye are under a great miſtake to think he was blind in his Soul; he was greatly enlightned in his Soul, and had a great Faith; and Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, and ſaid thy Faith hath ſaved thee, which proveth he was not blind in his Soul, when he ſo prayed. They ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſatisfied, and greatly blaming that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of expreſſion, Son of <hi>David,</hi> as improper, <hi>William Penn</hi> ſaid, Friends we know that Chriſt after his Aſcenſion, call'd himſelf the root and off-spring of <hi>David:</hi> Now why may it not be ſuppoſed, that a Friend may be moved in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſay, O thou root and off-spring of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> have mercy on us. Some alſo brought that place in <hi>Acts.</hi> 7.59. how <hi>Stephen</hi> being fill'd with the Holy Ghoſt, at his death, call'd, ſaying, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit;</hi> ſo after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral words of diſcourſe made by other Friends preſent, moſtly approving my aſſertion: they paſſed to their Third particular charg'd againſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95758:240"/>in my Book; the paſſage in my Book that they blam'd, is in pag. 123. Compared with pag. 136. where I had ſaid pag. 123. <q>He is that mighty one, upon whom the Father hath laid help, for that although the Father himſelf loveth us, and is moſt willing and ready to help us in all our Neceſſities; yet we can no otherwiſe receive his help, but as it comes to us by the Conveyance of the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> our alone Mediator. And pag. 136. I had ſaid. —But ſtill as in reſpect of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Manifeſtation, and Operation, and alſo in reſpect of Communion and Fellowſhip, the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> or word Incarnate, is the only and proper middle and Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us; ſo that whereas God is immediately United with the Man <hi>Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> no other Men, or Angels have, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are Capable to have an immediate Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, their Union is only Mediate with God, and ſo their Communion and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him is but Mediate alſo; by the means of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> although inreſpect of other means, it is Immediate.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All this paſſage they mightily cenſured, as Contradicting their own experience: 'tis true, ſaid they, when we were Young and weak, at our firſt Convincement and Beginning, we had need of Chriſt, but now we have no need of him, we have acceſs to God Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, without Chriſt, <hi>Thomas Hart</hi> reply'd to them, Friends I am ſorry you ſhould think ye have not need of Chriſt now, I cannot ſay ſo, and I dare not ſay it. I have as much need of him now as ever formerly, I need

Theſe words of <hi>Thomas Hart</hi> were much noticed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by divers Preſent, and after divers had ſpoke their minds about this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, particularly <hi>George Whitehead</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Penn,</hi> who approved and Vindicated all theſe Three Particulars, which my oppoſers have objected againſt and ſeverely cenſured, and all other leſſer Matters, to every tittle and word that was objected; ſo that I had, need to ſay little, and indeed ſaid not much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I found them, (as ſeemed to me) well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and inclined to anſwer for me, as they readily did. Divers other Friends preſent, ſtood up in the Meeting and declar'd their great Satisfaction, with having heard thoſe things ſo well cleared and opened to their underſtandings, which they Confeſſed, they had been formerly Mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about, and bleſſed God for that good opportunity they had, to have things made ſo clear to them, among whom were <hi>Francis More,</hi> and <hi>James Claypool</hi> both Citizens of good account, and of good reputation among Friends and Neighbours. This is but a Summary and Abreviation of the matter, which was much more largely diſcourſed, and took up ſeveral hours time at each Meeting. In the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the perſons that had accuſed me were deſir'd by the Meeting, to deſiſt from their Charge, and ſay nothing againſt the Book: and whereas ſome Friends that were diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at my Book, had forbidden the Stationer

And now Reader, wouldeſt thou not think that theſe men who had ſo expoſed their Ignorance, Unbelief, and Antichriſtian principles directly oppoſeſt to the great Fundamentals of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, would have received ſome ſevere Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from the Friends of the Miniſtry, or at leaſt, that they would have put them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own their vile errors, before they could be owned, as either ſound Miniſters, or ſound Friends? But nothing of this was done, and to the certain knowledge of divers as well as mine, theſe men, (as well as others that had privately ſided with them,) remained Reſolute and Stiff in their former errors, whereof the one, to wit <hi>William Shewen,</hi> ſometime after gave a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick demomſtration in the Face of the World, having after all this, printed a Book called by him <hi>A Treatiſe of Thoughts,</hi> where he ſaith pag. 37. Not to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham, David,</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> Saint or Angel, but to God the Father, all worſhip, Honour and Glory is to be given through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Note Reader what he means by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt &amp;c.</hi> is eaſie to apprehend, not the Son of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Mary,</hi> for him he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from being the object of Worſhip; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Saints and Angels, as in his own words is manifeſt, but this <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. is the <hi>Light within,</hi> ſo here are two Chriſts with a witneſs by this Man's Doctrin, one the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95758:243"/>Son of <hi>David,</hi> to whom no Worſhip Honour and Glory is to be given, another through whom God the Father is to be Worſhiped; and certainly he through whom we Worſhip God the Father, muſt be the object of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip together with the Father: But how long did he allow <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> to be him thro' whom God the Father is to be Worſhiped? No longer than <hi>untill he hath reſtored all things into their primitive Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that is, brought</hi> William Shewen <hi>and his Brethren to a Sinleſs ſtate, which many think they have attain'd already, and then Chriſt in them is known to ſurrender up the Kingdom to the Father, and God to become all in all.</hi> As he plainly declares in his pag. 38. and on the Margin he adds, <hi>This is the aſſending of Chriſt up, where he was before he deſcended, and before there was any Cauſe for his deſcenſion, he that can underſtand</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let him.</hi> (this paſſage of <hi>Wiliam Shewen,</hi> is more fully Quoted out of his Book in my Third Narrative lately Printed) Judge Reader, what imaginary Heavens had this man got up into, after he hath witneſſed a Sinleſs ſtate, even in the mortal Body, then Chriſt ſurrenders up the Kingdom to the Father, in him, and it is no more Chriſt in him, but God all in all. And what Chriſt ſpoke of his Aſcenſion, as Man, into Heavens without us, He wholly applyeth, to Chriſt's putting off his Offices as Chriſt, and ceaſing any more to Officiate as Chriſt in them, but as God the Father. The myſtery of this is Rank and wild Ranteriſm, to wit that God and Chriſt within men, are but two inward
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95758:244"/>Miniſtrations, and Operations; Chriſt is the lower, and the Father is the Higher, and by paſſing from the Lower to the Higher, as men paſs from the lower ſtory of a Houſe, to the higher, they paſs from Chriſt to God, and leave Chriſt behind or below them, and aſcend up to God all in all, and ſo need not Chriſt either within them, or without them. That this is the real and genuine Senſe of <hi>William Shewen's</hi> words in that above mentioned Treatiſe, any intelligent perſon that reads them, (more eſpecially if he read thoſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges throughout, from firſt to laſt, a part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have but quoted, for brevity ſake) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but acknowledge.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe it is probable many of the people call'd <hi>Quakers</hi> will ſay, that theſe things which I have above related as matter of Fact; are not truly related, and will be ready to oppoſe to the credit of my relation: That <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> who confeſſeth there was ſuch a Meeting where he was preſent, denyeth that he remembereth that any ſuch things were affirmed by them that found fault with me, for ſome things contained in my Book. But <hi>Firſt,</hi> his not remembering, is but a Negative evidence againſt my poſſitive evidence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not ſo ſtrong as mine. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I have brought <hi>William Shewen's</hi> own Book; Writ and Printed after that Meeting; ſufficiently declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at leaſt the Two laſt Particulars, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed all the Three. For ſince he conſtrueth Chriſt's Aſcenſion into Heaven, to be inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Men; he has left us no proofs for his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion outwardly. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> had <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:95758:244"/>been ingenuous, he would have been poſitive to have told what he did remember, ſeeing ſome preſent at theſe Meetings as old in years, and as weak in Memory as himſelf; hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lately told, what was ſaid in one of them Meetings, and that is the chiefeſt of the Three, and indeed includes all the three Particulars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mention'd. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> know then, for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence; that <hi>Thomas Heart</hi> an ancient Citizen, of very good credit and fame, (a perſon of greater Age than <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> as I ſuppoſe; and one whom <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> I think will own to be worthy of Credit in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, if not in this) hath lately declar'd to me, (in anſwer to my requeſt to him, that ſeeing. I was called in queſtion as a Lyer, for ſaying ſome of my oppoſers at one of theſe Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings had ſaid, they needed not Chriſt then, he would be pleaſed for the truths ſake, to ſpeak what he did remember was ſaid by them to that effect) that he did remember that they did ſay, <hi>They needed not Chriſt,</hi> and alſo that he did reply to them, <hi>It may be before they Dyed, they would find their need of Chriſt;</hi> thus he freely and voluntarily declared to me in my Houſe 22d. 12. Month. 1697. in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to my requeſt as above. I having told him, that to clear me of the Imputation of a Lyer, I did deſire him (by a few lines in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) to ſpeak with me, who came to my Houſe, in complyance to my deſire; and I having repeated to him all his words as they are above mentioned, that he ſpoke to them; he anſwered me directly, that his memory was weak, and did not remember the other paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95758:245"/>but this (ſaid he) I do well remember, that when ſome of them ſaid, they needed not Chriſt; I told them, before they Dyed they might come to find their need of him; and he ſaid further, I own it to be a truth that I need Chriſt ſtill, for I find my obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſo ſhort, that I cannot rely upon it; and therefore I need that God be merciful to me, and forgive me my ſins and failings for Chriſt's ſake. And diverſe things he ſpoke to this purpoſe, very ſenſibly and Chriſtianly, with which I was much refreſhed to find him ſo ſound and ſenſible, and that he ſtill adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his former Teſtimony he gave at one of theſe Meetings. And ſeeing he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the truth of my Relation, in one of the chief Particulars, that one containing all the reſt: I judge it is an Authentick evidence to the whole; for if they needed not Chriſt, then ſure they were not to Pray to him; and as ſure it is, that there is no need of any ſuch belief (according to their ſentiments) that Chriſt's Body did Aſcend into Heaven; for they having denyed the end of his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, which was that We might have him to be our merciful high Prieſt in Heaven, to make interceſſion for us, according to our need, they muſt conſequently deny his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, otherwiſe ſay he Aſcended to no purpoſe or end, as to us! For a further e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, I here add the Teſtimony of <hi>John Bull,</hi> who was preſent at one of theſe Meetings, who had alſo at my deſire and requeſt (obteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ſpeak the truth, ſeeing my Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Name and Reputation was concerned in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95758:245"/>the caſe) declared, <note place="margin">Note, <hi>ſince the writing of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per</hi> John-Bull <hi>is det ceaſed: Bu I have E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of ſome alive who heard him ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.</hi>
                  </note> that it having been long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, he did not remember much, but this he did remember, that they oppoſed to that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in my Book, wherein I did aſſert that Chriſt's Body that was buried, roſe again, and aſcended into Heaven. As alſo that ſeveral Friends ſaid, they were much benefited by the things that they heard diſcourſed, by way of Objections and Anſwers, and bleſſed God for that opportunity. This he told me at my Houſe 23d. 12th. <hi>Mo.</hi> 1697.</p>
               <p>Having thus finiſh'd my Relation, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe weighty Matters, which I ſolemnly declare to be true, and which I think I have give a ſufficient Evidence of, by the concurring Evidences, of ſome of their Brethren, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in Unity with them, it now remains to give ſome Reaſons of making publick this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which I do thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. My firſt Reaſon of making publick this Relation is to clear my Name both as a Man, and a Chriſtian, from the imputation of Lyer, Slanderer, and falſe Accuſer; which ſome of the contrary Party have caſt upon me, for my having affirmed, that ſome noted men among the Quakers, yea and Teachers too, Twenty years ago have oppos'd ſome of the great Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Chriſtianity, and greatly Cenſured me for aſſerting them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Reaſon, is, that this Account given by me here will ſerve for an Apologie, and Excuſe to me, in great part, why I have in ſome of my former Books, eſpecially in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies with ſome of the Preachers at <hi>Boſton</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:95758:246"/>in <hi>New England,</hi> praiſed and defended <hi>William Penn</hi> and <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> as ſound and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox in the Fundamental Principles of the Chriſtian Faith, Concerning Chriſt, and the real exiſtence of his Manhood-Nature, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a glorified Soul and Body in Heaven, being both God, and Man, and yet one Chriſt: And our Faith in him as ſuch, for Remiſſion of Sin, and eternal Salvation, whom theſe men did repreſent as unſound. Now that which gave me (as I thought) juſt ground ſo to judge, was, that they ſeemed to me, by the defence they made for me at theſe two Meetings aforeſaid, to be not only ſound in their judgements as touching theſe great truths, but to be cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and zealouſly concerned for the defence of them: And in this perſuaſion of them I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, until the differences aroſe in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> betwixt my Adverſaries and me, in the year 1691, concerning the neceſſity of Faith in Chriſt without us, for Remiſſion of Sin, and eternal Salvation, as well as the beleif of his inward appearance by his Light and Grace in our hearts, both which I affirmed was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to our Chriſtianity, which my Adverſaries roſe up againſt, charging it to be falſe as well new Doctrine, and contradicting the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Teſtimonies and Books of ſound Friends, and particularly of <hi>William Penn,</hi> and <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> ſo that I was accuſed by my <hi>Penſilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> oppoſers, in our publick Meetings there, for contradicting the Principles of <hi>William Penn</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> in their Printed Books, particularly in that Book called the <hi>Chriſtian Quaker,</hi> both in relation to <hi>the ſufficiency of the Light within,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95758:246"/>without any thing elſe, to Salvation,</hi> and alſo in relation to the Reſurrection of the Body. And thus time after time they oppoſed me with theſe men's Books, and when I deſir'd them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the Scriptures, and prove the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of my Doctrine firſt to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and then it was time to Conſider theſe men's Books, <hi>Samuel Jennings</hi> in a publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> on a firſt day, ſaid it was not neceſſary to prove me guilty of Hereſie, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had accus'd me) from the Scriptures, but from Friends Books, for (ſaid he) the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion betwixt, <hi>G. K.</hi> and them, is not who is the beſt <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but who is the beſt <hi>Quaker.</hi> And though I ſtill deſir'd them to bring their Scripture proofs, yet they for moſt part waved that, and continued clamouring that my Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine contradicted <hi>Will. Pen. Geo. Whitehead,</hi> and other Friends, which I did not know all that time that it did, for though the places they quoted out of their Books, ſeemed much to favour my Adverſaries, yet I was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to think ſo, but labour'd to retain my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable perſwaſion of them, putting the moſt Charitable Conſtructions upon their Words as was poſſible, ſo farr as I had read the paſſages in their Books that ſeemed to interfere with me. At laſt, I came to a firm Reſolution in my mind to Come for <hi>England,</hi> having firſt writ to <hi>George Whitehead</hi> and other Friends of the Miniſtry about our differences, deſiring to know their ſenſe; they ſeemed to blame me for the ſeparation, but in great part, to approve of my Principles; but the words in their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were ſo dubious, like the Heathen Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95758:247"/>that as to the main difference of Principles betwixt my Adverſaries, and me in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> it was rather increas'd by their Epiſtles, then allayd; my Adverſaries Conſtruing them one way, and I and my Friends another way. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I arrived in <hi>England</hi> and came to <hi>London,</hi> And had ſome private Conferrences with <hi>George Whitehead</hi> and <hi>William Penn,</hi> about theſe very Principles <hi>of the ſufficiency of the Light within to Salvation, without any thing elſe,</hi> by the <hi>ſomething elſe</hi> that I did plead for, declaring that I meant the man Chriſt Jeſus, and his moſt holy and perfect Obedience unto death, for our Sins, and his Interceſſion for us in Heaven, I began eaſily to perceive that they greatly differed from me in thoſe great things, yet they did ſeek to hide themſelves as much as they well could, mainly and almoſt only blaming me for the Separation, and making a breach, in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and the neighbouring Provinces among Friends. But by degrees, the difference in Principles betwixt them and me began plainly to appear, before they Excommunicated me, at their yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Year 1695. For at a large Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Friends of the Miniſtry, where were many Country Friends, about two days before the yearly meeting, in 1694. <hi>William Penn</hi> accuſed me, for ſeeking to bring in a new method of Preaching Chriſt, and Faith in him, differing from that of Friends, and that new method was, to preach the Man Chriſt without us, and his Death and Sufferings, in order to bring people to know the Divine Principle within them, and the work of Regeneration. And at the ſaid Meeting <hi>G. W.</hi> blamed me, for affirming that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95758:247"/>all the Light and Grace that any men had, in any age of the World, was the effect of Chriſt's Obedience unto death for us, and argued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it thus, Men had Light and Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt came in the Fleſh, to perform that obedience: can the Effect be before the Cauſe? this plainly enough let me ſee into <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Principles, he had the ſame ſtrength of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (but that's none at all) againſt any mens having Remiſſion of Sin by Chriſt's death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came in the Fleſh, why, can the effect be before the Cauſe? I told him, a Moral effect can be before its cauſe, and oft times is, and gave an Example, how a man by a Contract or Covenant buyeth a Houſe or Field, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth it before the Money is paid, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Covenant being that the Money is not to be paid until ſuch a time, ſo by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Covenant of Grace, which reſpected Chriſt to Come, and the ſatisfaction he was to make to divine juſtice, by his Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for mens ſins paſt, as well as to come, all the faithful had remiſſion of ſin, and inward Light and Grace, as well before he came as ſince. And ſome Months after this, at a publick Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Quakers</hi> at <hi>Ratcliff</hi> by <hi>London, William Penn</hi> did publickly oppoſe my teſtimony, and charged me, to be an Apoſtate, and that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured to pluck up the teſtimony of truth by the roots. And at the ſame time He told the Auditory, that Friends ſaw no great need to preach the Faith of Chriſt's Death, and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for all <hi>England</hi> had that Faith, and all Chriſtendom had it, but it did not profit
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95758:248"/>them.<note n="*" place="margin">Reader by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument it ſhould not be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all.</note> With many Abuſive words all which he father'd upon a tranſport of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious power of God, at the next yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when I Complain'd upon his ſo abuſing me. Yet they have, after all this, ſought to hide the differences in Doctrine betwixt them and me, from publick notice, ſo that in their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication, they blame not my Doctrine, nor Morals in any particular thing, but caſt out ſome general charges againſt me, for being turbulent <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſeperating my ſelf from the Church of Chriſt. But their unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian dealings with me, as well as Antichriſtian Principles have ſufficiently proved them not to be a Church of Chriſt, though ſtill I have that charity to diverſe among them, that they belong to Chriſt and his Church; but not as reſpecting that viſible Society, that has leſs the face of a Church, than any Society of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants any where in the world.</p>
               <p>A third Reaſon is, that this publication of the foregoing Relation, will be a true Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Witneſs for me, that as to the great fundamentals of the Chriſtian Faith, I am not changed, from what I was Twenty years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, when own'd among them; and for many years after, acknowledg'd by them, that I was in the Unity. And that therefore it is manifeſt to be a Calumny and falſe Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rais'd by ſome Malicious Perſons among the <hi>Quakers</hi> againſt me; that I am Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed from my former Principles of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and have embraced new notions, or Prieſts and Profeſſors Principles, as they are pleaſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> that formerly I had relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95758:248"/>and from a tentation that I had let pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over me, to ſeek and affect preheminence over my Brethren, and not finding my deſire and end anſwered in that, I ſought occaſion to differ from them, and purpoſely chang'd my Principles, that I might have a ground of Strife and Contention with them, all which the Righteous Judge of the whole Earth, and the ſearcher of hearts knoweth to be falſe, and injurious charges. I have ſufficiently in my late Printed Books, proved that I am the ſame in all Principles of Truth, that I was formerly, and wherein I am changed, in ſome leſſer matters of Perſwaſion, it is to truth, and not from truth: God having been pleaſed further to Enlighten me, for which I deſire to Praiſe him; and I have ſhewed my adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, both <hi>William Penn</hi> and <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> to be much more guilty of Contradictions, than any thing that any have laid to my charge, as in my firſt Narrative of the proceedings at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> and in other late Books: And wherein they charge me, to contradict ſome paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in my former Books, as in relation to <hi>Baptiſm and the Supper,</hi> and the having a better underſtanding of ſome places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than formerly I had, this is properly no Contradiction, but a Retractation. But my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries are juſtly chargable with many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, that (without any Retractation) hold contradictory propoſitions at once to be both true. This is contradiction with a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:95758:249"/>Now judge Reader, whether as the above ſaid Relation of the particulars mentioned in the firſt Sheet, is not ſome Apology for me, to excuſe my praiſing <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> and <hi>William Penn,</hi> as Orthodox and ſound Men, as to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Principles, they having, by their ſeeming Orthodox at that time, Deceiv'd me, ſo hath not the late diſcovery of their inſoundneſſes in the Chriſtian Faith, given me a farr greater ground of Apology to excuſe my charging them, to be guilty of Vile Anti-Chriſtian Errors, as I have largely ſhewn in my late Printed Books, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly my three Naratives of the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> the Second and Third of which has as yet received no ſhadow of anſwer, and what ſhadow of anſwer the Firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by <hi>Thomas Elwood,</hi> hath been ſufficiently demonſtrated to be a meer Shadow, by the Book call'd <hi>Satan Diſrob'd,</hi> and alſo by my Second and Third Narratives, all which lye on their hand unanſwered; and yet they falſely glory in Print, that they have anſwered all my former Books. And their moſt partial ſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my Adverſaries in <hi>Penſelvania,</hi> to cloak their vile Errors, as well as unjuſt Practiſes, is another ground of my juſt Apology, for my changing my thoughts of them; beſides other great Prooffs I have to manifeſt their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and Anti-Chriſtian Principles.</p>

Now unto all you, this is the word of the Lord God; you that waits out of the Light wherewith you are Inlightened, waits out of the way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—Tell me, have not many of your Brethren and Siſters pretended this waiting who are dead, (take warning) and ſaid they looked as you do for a Chriſt to come, in another's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and not in your own.

                           <p>And now all ye that ſpeak of a Perſonal Reign, Anſwer this, from whence muſt this Chriſt come which muſt Reign Perſonally? Seeing the promiſes of God was but one, and to one; And all the Prophets of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſied but of one? and they declared of what Stock, and Family, and Houſe, and Generation he ſhould be off, Read <hi>Math.</hi> 1. and <hi>Luke.</hi> 3.

                           <p>Now Anſwer in plain words, whence muſt this Chriſt come you wait for? And in what Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration? Of what Family? And out of what Country? And of whom muſt he be born? that they may no Longer be deceived by you: who have kept them Gazing after a falſe Chriſt. Well may it be called Gazing.

                           <p>And Seeing the Scripture ſaith that Chriſt is the way to the Father,<note place="margin">

And doth not theſe that Look for a Chriſt to come, deny the way to God, tell me? What way muſt people go to God, if Chriſt be not come?

               <p>But this is not the ſubject I am upon.

In a Book of his, and other <hi>Quakers,</hi> call'd <hi>The Weſt anſwering to the North.</hi> Printed. <hi>An.</hi> 1657. p. 16. ther is a Long Letter to Chief Juſtice <hi>Glynn,</hi> which begins thus, <hi>Friend, we are Free-Men of</hi> England, <hi>Free-born; our Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties in and with our Countries, with the Laws, the Defence of them, have we in the Late Wars, Vindicated in the Field with our Blood.</hi> Which in the <hi>Journal</hi> is Alter'd thus. <hi>Friend; We are Free-Men of</hi> England, <hi>Free-born, Our Rights and Liberties are according to Law, and ought to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by it.</hi> Leaving out that Ugly Paſſage, <hi>The Defence of them, have we, in the Late Wars, Vindicated in the Field with our Blood.</hi> For this they have now a Mind ſhou'd be Forgotten.

               <p n="2">2. In the year 1659. One of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Great <hi>Apoſtles, Richard Hubberthorn</hi> wrote an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>A Declaration</hi> of the <hi>Ana-Baptiſts</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> wherein they <hi>Owned</hi> it as their <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> That they were <hi>Willing to Live peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder whatever Government is, or ſhall be Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Nation.</hi> This the <hi>Quakers</hi> then did violently <hi>Oppoſe,</hi> as a <hi>Poor, Time-ſerving,</hi> and <hi>Pernicious Principle,</hi> tho' of Late, they Pretend, That it is their own <hi>Principle,</hi> and that they do, <hi>Now,</hi> Govern themſelves by it; And Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſo to do. But then, they fell upon the <hi>Ana-Baptiſts,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>This is far below that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which was once in ſome of you in that Profeſſion: for you told of having the Laws regulated accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95758:266"/>to the Scriptures; And of having Judges as at the firſt, and Councellors as at the beginning: And then not to ſubmit to what Government ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but that which is according to Equity and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And what do you bear Arms, and Fight for, if not for a Government according to Truth, and that Righteouſneſs may Eſtabliſh the Nation? Some have Judged this to be the very Deſign and End of the War and Controverſy againſt many that were called Governors and Magiſtrates, and were by ſome called</hi> the Ordinance of God, <hi>and the</hi> Higher Power: <hi>And if now you Reſolve to live Peaceably, and ſubmit to whatever Government ſhall be Eſtabliſhed, then your Fighting is at an End: And if</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>ſhall come in, and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Popery, and Govern by Tyranny, you have begged Pardon, by Promiſing to live Peaceably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, as the Ordinance of God.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But this ſmelling ſo Rank, in the <hi>Re-Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>Hubberthorn</hi>'s Works <hi>An.</hi> 1663. they leave out the words <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> And inſtead of that, they put it thus, <hi>And if any Shall Come in and Eſtabliſh Popery</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Principle</hi> for the Breach of which they Charge the <hi>Ana-Baptiſts,</hi> was not Peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to the <hi>Ana-Baptiſts,</hi> nor any thing wherein they Differ'd from the <hi>Quakers;</hi> for it is moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>Quakers</hi> own words. But it was the Joint <hi>Principle</hi> of all theſe ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi> and is, and ever will be the <hi>Pretence</hi> of all <hi>Rebels,</hi> to <hi>Reforme,</hi> and <hi>Change</hi> for the <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> And to this, that <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Submitting</hi> to whatever <hi>Government</hi> is <hi>Eſtabliſhed,</hi> is moſt Adverſe. And for which the <hi>Quakers</hi> did, at that time, Upbraid this Pretence of the <hi>Ana-Baptiſts.</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:95758:267"/>As ſincere, perhaps, in the <hi>Ana-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> then, as it is in the <hi>Quakers</hi> now. For the <hi>Quakers Principle</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Higher Powers;</hi> And what they mean by the <hi>Higher Power,</hi> I Refer backward to 2. P. p. 172, 173. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Humphrey Smith</hi> a Notable <hi>Quaker</hi> Printed a Book An. 1658. Intitul'd, <hi>The True and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Rule from God. Publiſhed from the Spirit of Truth.</hi> Where p. 48. he ſays, <hi>Where are Queen</hi> Mary<hi>'s Judges and Bloody Perſecutors? Where are King</hi> Charles<hi>'s Nobles</hi>— <hi>and his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-Merciful Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, who ſought to Drive down all by their Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Power, who were as High in Tyranny</hi>—<hi>as any of you</hi>— <hi>Where are your Cardinals, Jeſuits, and Monks? Where are your Biſhops, Arch-Biſhops, Deans, and Deacons, your Abbots, Nunnerys, and Biſhopricks, Altars, Croſſes, Surplices, and Common-Prayer-Books, your Rails about your Tables, Organs, Quireſters, and Singing-Boys? Even as your Eyes have ſeen the Overturning of all theſe, ſo ſhall the Off-Spring and Reſidue follow after, and the Prieſts Howle.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But in the <hi>Re-Printing</hi> of this Man's <hi>Works</hi> after the <hi>Restoration,</hi> All that concerning King <hi>Charles,</hi> his <hi>Nobles, Tyranny,</hi> &amp;c. And all concering the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> then Eſtabliſhed, of <hi>Biſhops, Deans, Common-Prayer, Surplices, Organs,</hi> &amp;c. are left quite out. Tho' ſaid to be <hi>Publiſh'd from the Spirit of Truth!</hi> But the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Convenience,</hi> and <hi>World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Politicks</hi> has Prevail'd.</p>
               <p>I have given but one <hi>Inſtance,</hi> a piece, in the <hi>Re-Printed Works</hi> of <hi>Fox, Hubberthorn,</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> becauſe I wou'd keep within Limits, this hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwell'd ſo much already. And if I ſhou'd
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95758:267"/>go thro' all, it wou'd take up more Paper than all that I have Written.</p>
               <p>But we wou'd Deſire them more Particularly to Produce two <hi>Tracts</hi> they have taken care to ſtifle; one is a Piece of <hi>Parnell's</hi> call'd <hi>Satan's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,</hi> mention'd 2 P. p. 106. The other of <hi>Lawſon</hi>'s mention'd <hi>ibid.</hi> p. 108.</p>
               <p>And now the Reaſon appears Plain, Why the <hi>Quakers</hi> are ſo Diligent in keeping up the <hi>Firſt Editions</hi> of their <hi>Friends</hi> Books. That none might be ſeen, but as they have <hi>New-Dreſt</hi> and <hi>Vaumpt</hi> them. Their <hi>Book-ſellers</hi> have Refus'd to <hi>Sell</hi> them, or ſo much as <hi>Shew</hi> them to ſeveral that I have Employ'd. Particularly <hi>W. Penn's Sandy Foundation.</hi> And where one I ſent had found <hi>Six</hi> of them, over night; next day, when I ſent for them, not one of them was to be had. When he is Dead, that too muſt paſs the <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> with the Reſt of his <hi>Works.</hi> If <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> be not out of Faſhion before that time; which I Hope he may Live to ſee.</p>
               <p>If they wou'd Call in, or Commit to the <hi>Flames</hi> all their <hi>Old Editions,</hi> I ſhou'd be very well Pleas'd to Rake no More into them; But let them and their <hi>Hereſies</hi> Die together. And let the Preſent <hi>Quakers</hi> ſlide <hi>Gently</hi> from their <hi>Errors,</hi> without the <hi>Shame</hi> of <hi>Recanting.</hi> For it is their <hi>Converſion,</hi> not <hi>Victory</hi> over them that we ſeek.</p>
               <p>But when theſe <hi>Old</hi> Quaker <hi>Books,</hi> are ſtill kept as <hi>Sacred Relicts</hi> by the <hi>Generality</hi> of the <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Beſotted Quakers.</hi> And their Now <hi>Governing</hi> and <hi>Subtile Teachers,</hi> in all the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> they have, of Late, Publiſhed, ſtill Pretend
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95758:268"/>to ſtand by, and Confirm All the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> and <hi>Writings</hi> of their <hi>Ancient Friends,</hi> and that <hi>In all the Parts of them:</hi> And that they are thus En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd by the <hi>Yearly Epiſtle</hi> of their <hi>General Council,</hi> as ſuppoſing them all <hi>Infallible,</hi> and <hi>Dictated</hi> by the <hi>Immediate Inſpiration</hi> of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt,</hi> as they <hi>Horridly</hi> Pretend (yet are not <hi>Afraid</hi> to <hi>Alter, Correct,</hi> and <hi>Amend</hi> them!) It becomes <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> and our <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>Search out,</hi> and <hi>Expoſe</hi> them. That being the Moſt Likely Means to <hi>Open</hi> thoſe <hi>Eyes,</hi> which are not <hi>Seal'd</hi> up, to their own <hi>Deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, let others think, That if the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi> of <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> be ſo <hi>Abhorrent,</hi> even as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented</hi> to Us, in their <hi>Re-Printed,</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Books;</hi> How ten times more <hi>Deform'd</hi> and <hi>Frightful</hi> it wou'd Appear, if taken off their firſt <hi>Rude Draught,</hi> if their <hi>Original Books</hi> were <hi>Expos'd</hi> to <hi>Publick view;</hi> if the <hi>Publick</hi> wou'd take ſome Method, to have them <hi>Collected,</hi> and <hi>Reſerv'd</hi> in ſome ſafe Place, till ther ſhou'd be no Longer Uſe for them, but what they firſt Deſerv'd, the Animadverſion of the <hi>Hang-Man,</hi> and a <hi>Faggot.</hi>

                        <p>IN the New Law neither Chriſt nor any of his Apoſtles took Tythes of the People, nor Commanded the People to pay Tythes, neither to Prieſts nor Deacons.</p>
                        <p>But in the 1000 year of Our Lord 211. One Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 10th. Ordained Tythes Firſt to be Given to Prieſts.</p>
                        <p>Again, Paul ſaith, He was not Chargeable unto them but with his hands got his Own Living. It were Good Councel That all Prieſts took Good heed to the Heavenly Learning of <hi>Paul,</hi> not Charging the People for their Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Livelyhood. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith ſince the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is Changed its neceſſary a Change alſo be made of the Law, ſo that Prieſts Live without Tythes— For the Prieſts that Challenge Tythes ſay in effect, <hi>That Chriſt is not become Man,</hi> nor that he Suffered Death for man's Love.</p>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95758:273"/>that it may not produce the taking of an Ell, through the allowance of an Inch; and that they ſhould ſtir up Sober, Virtuous People to take notice how far they that wear them are neceſſitated thereto; and if ſo, what Modeſty they uſed therein.

Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> wore a White Coat, and writes in defence thereof. So did <hi>John Huſs</hi> the Martyr, the eminenteſt Preacher in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and bequeathed his White Coat to one, his Gray Coat to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; not his White Wig to one, his Brown Wig to another. He ſuffered for oppoſing Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers Pride.</p>

                              <pb n="88" facs="tcp:95758:274"/>It remains to ſhew, That 'tis not an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a Deformity, more then that it would Cover, as if it were not in Faſhion would appear, even to the ſimple natural Eye. The <hi>Americans</hi> ſeeing one, <hi>Captain Morley,</hi> take off his Wig, cryed he had two Heads. And 'twere apt to affright a Child unuſed to it, like the horrid and hideous Head of a Snake-hair-twiſted <hi>Gorgon,</hi> or criſted <hi>Bellona;</hi> as <hi>Homer</hi> ſays <hi>Hector</hi> did his Son with his <hi>Horſe-maned Helmet.</hi> And who can refrain to fall into a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etical Vein, and Paint it out in ſuch ſad Colours, that it may look as ugly as it doth: For a glorying in a Shame, as an Ornament, ſharpens a Pen to deſcribe it to make it appear as it is. <hi>Difficile eſt ſatyram non ſcribere.</hi>
